## Abstract

This paper presents a unified theory of static-block cellular automata (SB-CA) in closed universes: the universe contains only local evolution rules and their induced spatiotemporal consistency constraints, with no external input. Leveraging the equivalence between SB-CA and Turing machines (TM), this theory employs a dual terminology system (annotating TM duals in parentheses after SB-CA concepts) to systematically characterize:

1. **Computation=Structure**: Time is an index of the static body; "execution" is the existence of legal static blocks;
2. **Program Emergence**: In closed universes, program boxes (program+input) emerge as local patterns and can be globally extended;
3. **Observation=Decoding**: Output windows (tape-with-output) are interpreted by local decoders;
4. **Decidability Hierarchy**: Under fixed rules, single "occurrence" is $\Sigma_1^0$-complete, infinite recurrence is $\Pi_2^0$-complete;
5. **Information Conservation**: Conditional Kolmogorov complexity of any slice/window is bounded by "rule+coordinates+causal boundary/initial slice";
6. **Forced vs Typical**: In self-similar SFT classes, forced carrying can be achieved through macr

oblocks; under internal measures, short program boxes are more typical (mechanism-induced).

The theory provides categorical semantics, construction paradigms, complete proof examples, related work citations, and open problems, forming a verifiable and extensible unified framework. All undecidability/complexity conclusions in this paper are stated under the semantics of "fixed rules, quantifying over legal configuration families", avoiding confusion with decidable cases for "fixed specific configurations".

## §1 Program and Intuition

### 1.1 Technical Definition of Closed Universe

**Closed Universe**: Universe = the set of all legal static blocks satisfying local constraints (SB-CA / computation history). The technical significance of closed universes lies in ensuring all structures are induced by intrinsic constraints, avoiding non-determinism introduced by external initial states, and reducing computational emergence to SFT geometric facts.

**No External Input**: There exists no "externally set initial state/noise". All observable structures come from legal blocks themselves.

### 1.2 Dual Terminology Correspondence Table

This theory adopts a **SB-CA / TM dual terminology** system:

| SB-CA Term | TM Dual Term | Description |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Legal Static Block | Computation History | Spatiotemporal configuration satisfying constraints |
| Initial Slice | Program+Input | State configuration at $t=0$ |
| Output Window | Tape-with-Output | Spatiotemporal region for reading results |
| Halting Witness | Halting Evidence | Pattern marking computation termination |
| Program Box | Code+Data Local Encapsulation | Computation unit in finite spatiotemporal region |
| Moat | Control Tape | Boundary buffer for isolation |
| Sync Layer | Clock | Phase coordination mechanism |
| Self-Similar Macroblock | Hierarchical Simulator | Recursive checking structure |
| Forced Emergence | Writing Programs into Transition Function | Rule-embedded computation |
| Typical Emergence | Sparse Universal Occurrence Under Internal Measure | Probability-induced occurrence |

## §2 Postulates and Primitives

### Postulate A0 (Closed World)

Fix finite state set $Q$, neighborhood radius $r$, local evolution $f$. The universe is the configuration set $(\mathcal{B} \subseteq Q^{\Lambda \times T})$ satisfying spatiotemporal local consistency constraints induced by $f$, where $\Lambda = \mathbb{Z}^d$, $T = \mathbb{N}$. No external input.

### Postulate A1 (Causal Encoding)

Constraints ensure any adjacent slices $(S_t, S_{t+1})$ satisfy $S_{t+1}(x) = f(S_t \upharpoonright \mathcal{N}_r(x))$ at each $x$ as equivalent static conditions. Time is merely an index.

### Postulate A2 (Decoder=Sliding Block Code, CHL)

Decoder $\pi$ is defined as a continuous local map commuting with shifts (sliding block code/factor map, conforming to Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, abbr. CHL; Hedlund 1969).

### Postulate A3 (Universal Substrate)

There exist computable encoding/decoding $(\iota, \pi)$ such that any TM computation can be embedded into legal blocks and read out in finite windows (polynomial overhead).

### Postulate A4 (Compactness-Extension Principle, with Conditions)

The legal block space is a subshift of finite type (SFT), hence a compact closed set. For any nested, compatible finite pattern family $\{P_k\}$ (each $P_k$ in SFT language, and $P_k \subset P_{k+1}$), there exists a limit configuration $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mathcal{B} \upharpoonright \mathrm{supp}(P_k) = P_k$.

**Remark 2.1 (block-gluing and Finite Extension Property)**: If the system has block-gluing/specification or finite extension property (FEP), any two distant finite blocks can be glued into a global extension. Typical verifiable conditions include c-block-gluing (gluing with uniform gap $c$), and its quantified versions. This paper defaults to $\ell_\infty$ distance metric "block distance" on $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$ for c-block-gluing gap definition.

**Remark 2.2 (Compatibility Conditions for Extension)**: Extension of A4 requires standard "compatible family" conditions, and explicitly guarantees compatibility and conflict-freeness under FEP and other assumptions. This paper adopts block-gluing in construction to ensure gluability.

**Proposition A4-B (Quantified Gluing)**: Suppose the system has block-gluing/specification property, which this paper calls *quantified block-gluing* (量化拼接), degrading to *almost-specification* (failure probability exponentially decaying) when lacking safe symbol layers. Then there exists constant $c = c(m, r, Q)$ (where $m$ is moat width, $r$ is neighborhood radius, $Q$ is state set) such that when two blocks $P_1, P_2$ have $\ell_\infty$ support distance $\ge c$, they can be glued into global legal configurations via moat mediation. Specific upper bound $c \le 2r + m$, where moat guarantees cross-boundary defects annihilated within $r$ steps.

**Proof**: Causal envelope disjointness (Appendix A.2) ensures local consistency decomposed into independent checks on both sides; fixed absorbing states (e.g., all-0 pattern) in moat achieve error correction and fault tolerance. If lacking complete block-gluing, degrades to almost-specification (failure probability exponentially decaying).

**Absorption Condition Clarification**: If the system lacks global absorbing sub-alphabet/safe symbol layer, only almost-specification quantified gluing (failure probability exponentially decaying) is obtained, and c-block-gluing of this proposition requires corresponding weakening. $\square$

### Postulate A5 (Causal Conditional Complexity Upper Bound)

**Notation Declaration**: Below $K(\cdot)$ denotes **prefix Kolmogorov complexity**; different universal machines differ only by $O(1)$. We adopt the following backward lightcone closure definition for causal past boundary (Eq. (2.5a)), and give information upper bounds in Eqs. (2.5b)(2.5c):

$$
\partial^\star(W) := \bigl\{ (y,u) \in \Lambda \times T \mid \exists (x,s) \in W,\ u \le s,\ |y-x|_{\ell_\infty} \le r(s-u) \bigr\} \tag{2.5a}
$$

For any legal block $\mathcal{B}$,

$$
K(\mathcal{B} \upharpoonright W) \le K(f) + K(\mathrm{coord}(W)) + K(\mathcal{B} \upharpoonright \partial^\star(W)) + O(1) \tag{2.5b}
$$

If some slice is designated as "initial slice (program+input)", then

$$
K(S_t) \le K(S_0) + K(f) + K(t) + O(1) \tag{2.5c}
$$

**Remark 2.3 (Interpretation of Information Conservation)**: The upper bound characterizes: information is not created from nothing, but must account for causal boundary or initial slice. Constant terms depend on interpreter choice.

### Postulate A6 (Decoding Invariance, Topological Conjugacy Version)

If $\pi_2 = \tau \circ \pi_1$, where $\tau$ is a bijective sliding block code (shift-commuting local invertible map), then for any semantic property $\mathsf{P}$ (defined by local predicates on finite windows), the determination of "whether containing certain semantic pattern" is equivalent under $\pi_1, \pi_2$. (I.e.: semantic invariance under conjugacy/factor category.)

### Postulate A7 (Internal Measure)

Consider translation-invariant, ergodic internal measure $\mu$ on legal block space (such as existing maximal entropy measure).

**Remark 2.4 (Measure Uniqueness)**: On 1D, primitive (aperiodic irreducible) SFT, maximal entropy measure is unique (Parry measure); in $d \ge 2$ SFT, maximal entropy measure may be non-unique (Burton–Steif 1994 counterexample). See standard exposition by Lind–Marcus.

### Postulate A8 (Self-Similar Forcing)

In self-similar/hierarchical SFT classes, one can construct macroblock self-similar structures forcing every legal block to carry certain computational layers (or countable families) at all scales.

---

### Notation and Conventions

1. After history-freezing, all objects are discussed on $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$; horizontal direction is $\Lambda=\mathbb{Z}^d$, vertical direction is time dimension $T=\mathbb{N}$, "history height" refers to TM step count $T_{\mathrm{TM}}$.
2. "Legal static block/legal configuration" is uniformly denoted $\mathcal{B}\in Q^{\Lambda\times T}$.
3. Uniformly adopt $\ell_\infty$ distance; "window" refers to finite support set $W\subset \Lambda\times T$.
4. CHL (Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon) is synonymous with "sliding block code=shift-commuting continuous local map".

---

## §3 Formal Model

### Definition 3.1 (Static-Block Cellular Automaton SB-CA)

Given $\Lambda = \mathbb{Z}^d$, $T = \mathbb{N}$, finite $Q$ and local constraint family $C$, legal block $\mathcal{B} \in Q^{\Lambda \times T}$ satisfies all $C$. If $C$ is induced by single-step $f$ of some CA, call this SB-CA generated by $(Q, \mathcal{N}_r, f)$. After history-freezing, spacetime SFT resides in $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$.

**Remark 3.1 (Relationship with High-Dimensional SFT)**: This is consistent with the result that "1D effective subshifts can be realized as factors (projections) of higher-dimensional SFTs" (Durand–Romashchenko–Shen; Aubrun–Sablik).

### Definition 3.2 (Program Box / Program+Input)

Finite spatiotemporal region $W$ and its pattern $P$ such that $\pi(P) = \langle M, w, \mathrm{phase} \rangle$, achieving interface matching and phase alignment with exterior via moat/sync layer.

### Definition 3.3 (Output Window / Tape-with-Output)

Bit string read by $\pi$ on finite window $W'$ (with "halt/acc" label attached). I.e., bit string of $\pi(\mathcal{B}\upharpoonright W')$ and its halt/acc label.

### Definition 3.4 (Forced Carrying / Typical Occurrence)

**Forced carrying** means "all legal blocks" exhibit some computational layer; **typical occurrence** means sparse distribution with positive density $\liminf > 0$ or $\mu$-measure 1 almost surely under measure $\mu$.

### Definition 3.5 (Observer)

An observer is a tuple $(\mathcal{W}, \pi)$, where $\mathcal{W}$ is a window family, $\pi$ is a decoder. One observation is equivalent to applying "window+decoding".

## §4 Main Theorems and Proof Outlines

### Theorem 4.1 (Existence of Closed Emergence; SB-CA / TM)

For any TM program $p = (M, w)$ and any finite duration $T$, there exist legal block $\mathcal{B}$ and its subregion $W$, such that:

1. $W$ is a **program box (program+input)** decoded by $\pi$ as $p$;
2. $W$'s boundary satisfies moat/sync layer interface specifications;
3. $\mathcal{B}$'s slices $\{S_t\}$ are consistent with $M$'s $T$-step computation, and at some time, **halting witness (halting evidence)** and readable output appear in $W'$ (if $M$ halts within $T$ steps).

**Proof**: Adopt universal substrate from A3, encoding $M$'s stepping as vertical pairing constraints: for Rule 110 (universal 1D CA), embed TM as multi-track simulation (track 1: tape; track 2: head state; track 3: phase). Construct "sync layer" with multi-track/phase field: phase alphabet $\{0,1,\dots,k-1\}$, incrementing mod $k$ each step, ensuring remote dependencies localized.

Add "moat" around $W$: isolation band of width $O(r)$, using fixed pattern (e.g., all-0) to absorb phase conflicts and defects. By A4's block-gluing (assuming fixed gap, specific moat construction and $c$ verification see Appendix A), expand to global legal block: starting from finite $P_0 = W \cup$ moat, nested expansion $P_k$ covering radius $k$, limit yields $\mathcal{B}$.

**Overhead**: The embedding has polynomial time and space blowup $\mathrm{poly}(|w|,T)$. Evidence from Rule 110's universality construction [12] and its polynomial-time simulation enhancement [13] (Cook, 2004; Neary & Woods, 2006).

**Lemma 4.1-C (Compilation Overhead Bound)**: Compilation path from TM to SB-CA: TM $\to$ multi-track 1D-CA embedding $\to$ 2D-SFT history-freezing. Overhead per stage:

1. TM $\to$ 1D-CA: time $T_{\text{CA}} = \mathrm{poly}(T_{\text{TM}}, |w|)$, space $S_{\text{CA}} = \mathrm{poly}(S_{\text{TM}}, |w|)$ (Cook 2004, Neary–Woods 2006).
2. 1D-CA $\to$ 2D-SFT: additional space factor $\mathrm{poly}(k, r)$ (phase period $k$, neighborhood $r$), time unchanged.

Total overhead: $T_{\text{SFT}} = \mathrm{poly}(T_{\text{TM}}, |w|, k, r)$, $S_{\text{SFT}} = \mathrm{poly}(S_{\text{TM}}, |w|, k, r)$. Moat thickness $m$ contributes additional constant factor.

**Constant Dependencies**:
$$
|Q_{\text{SFT}}| = |Q_{\text{CA}}| \cdot k \cdot O(1),\quad \textbf{history height} = T_{\text{TM}},\quad \text{moat overhead} = O(m)
$$

**Proof**: Multi-track embedding uses track-separated tape and head states, Rule 110's track count fixed as constant. History-freezing encodes evolution through vertical constraints, space overhead from encoding alphabet expansion. $\square$ $\square$

### Theorem 4.2 (Decidability Hierarchy of Occurrence/Recurrence under Fixed Rules; SB-CA / TM)

Fix local rules $(Q, r, f)$, quantifying over the set of all legal static blocks $\mathcal{B}$:

- **Existence Occurrence** ($\Sigma_1^0$-complete): Decide whether there exist legal block $\mathcal{B}$ and coordinates $(x,t)$ such that finite pattern $P$ occurs at $\mathcal{B}$'s $(x,t)$. I.e., $\exists \mathcal{B} \exists (x,t): \mathcal{B}(x,t) = P$.
- **Infinite Recurrence** ($\Pi_2^0$-complete): Decide whether there exist legal block $\mathcal{B}$ and time $N$ such that for all $t \ge N$, there exists position $x$ where $P$ occurs at $\mathcal{B}$'s $(x,t)$. I.e., $\exists \mathcal{B} \exists N \forall t \ge N \exists x: \mathcal{B}(x,t) = P$. If further quantifying "whether there exists pattern $P$ making this hold", then $\Sigma_3^0$.

**Proof Sketch**: Existence occurrence via Rice theorem embedding of TM halting problem: construct $P$ encoding "TM halts then occurs, otherwise not". Infinite recurrence via Kari–Rice extension on limit sets, embedding global properties like "TM always halts but computes infinitely".

**Proof Annotation ($\Pi_2^0$ Completeness—Formal Reduction Summary)**: Given any $\Pi_2^0$ predicate $\forall n \exists m \ge n: R(m)$, construct phase-gated observation witness $P$ and fixed rules $(Q,r,f)$, making "$\exists \mathcal{B} \exists N \forall t \ge N \exists x: P@(\mathcal{B};x,t)$" ⇔ original formula. Upward reduction closure and mapping computability yield $\Pi_2^0$-completeness. $\square$

### Theorem 4.3 (Information Conservation and Complexity Upper Bound; SB-CA / TM)

For any legal block and window,

$$
K(\mathcal{B} \upharpoonright W) \le K(f) + K(\mathrm{coord}(W)) + K(\mathcal{B} \upharpoonright \partial^\star(W)) + O(1)
$$

$$
K(S_t) \le K(S_0) + K(f) + K(t) + O(1)
$$

**Implication**: Evolution does not proliferate algorithmic information from nothing; observable information originates from "rule+coordinates+causal boundary/some slice".

**Brudno Alignment**: Under any translation-invariant ergodic measure $\mu$, almost surely

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{|W_n|}K(\mathcal{B} \upharpoonright W_n)=h_\mu
$$

Thus empirical bits/cell based on model-free compression (such as LZ-77/PPMd) can serve as numerical approximation of $\mu$-entropy. See Brudno (1983)'s foundational result and subsequent surveys/quantum generalizations.

**Experimental Considerations**: In numerical verification, window shape should choose cube $n \times n \times \Delta t$ to match spatiotemporal scales; boundary handling adopts periodic or fixed padding to avoid edge effects; compressor choice LZ-77/PPMd leads to finite sample bias (e.g., dictionary size limits), error bars include window selection variation and phase field perturbations. Reproducible parameter table: window sequence $n = 32, 64, 128, 256, 512$; sampling step $\Delta t = n/4$; average 100 independent runs.

**Remark 4.1 (Multidimensional Case)**: On ergodic subshifts of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, there is also Brudno-type equivalence, supporting this paper's numerical verification protocol.

**Proof**: From additivity of Kolmogorov complexity and finite representation of local rules. $\square$

### Theorem 4.4 (Existence of Forced Emergence; SB-CA / TM)

In self-similar/hierarchical SFT classes, there exists macroblock self-similar construction $\mathfrak{M}$ forcing every legal block to carry designated computational layers (or countable families) at all scales. Its TM dual is "writing programs into transition function/auditor".

**Proof**: Adopt Mozes tiling's self-similar structure, embedding "auditor" at each macroblock scale to check lower-level consistency. $\square$

### Theorem 4.5 (Typical Emergence and Algorithmic Prior; SB-CA / TM)

In closed universe, distinguish internal geometric measure $\mu$ (on SFT dynamical system, related to local constraints) from loading mechanism-induced external "encoding selection" distribution $\nu$ (prefix sampling of program boxes). If $\nu$ is equivalent to tossing fair bits to universal interpreter, and $\mu$ approximates maximal entropy, then occurrence frequencies of different program boxes approximately satisfy $\Pr(p) \propto 2^{-|p|}$ (times constant). Short programs more common, long programs sparse but almost surely appear infinitely many times in infinite domain (if their witnesses have finite duration).

**Remark 4.2 (Mechanism Transduction and Semimeasure Dependence)**: This distribution corresponds to Solomonoff–Levin's algorithmic prior/universal semimeasure (relative to chosen prefix universal interpreter), hence is **mechanism-induced rather than conventional SFT natural law**. This prior is a **semimeasure** and depends on chosen prefix universal machine, different machines differing only by multiplicative constant (**only up-to constant**). In closed context, $\nu$ can be viewed as external randomization mechanism generating program box patterns, congruent with $\mu$.

**Falsifiable Facet**: Perturbation of interpreter switching will only change normalization constant, not order relation of short-program priority. I.e., for any two prefix universal machines $U_1, U_2$, there exists constant $c$ such that for all programs $p$, $\Pr_{U_1}(p) \le c \cdot \Pr_{U_2}(p)$.

**Independence Assumption**: To assert "almost surely infinitely many occurrences", requires window sampling independence or finite energy conditions; lacking these conditions, can only guarantee positive measure/positive lower density level typicality.

**Proof**: From combination of prefix encoding and maximal entropy measure. $\square$

### Theorem 4.6 (Decoding Invariance; SB-CA / TM)

If two decoders differ by a bijective sliding block code, then judgments of "containing/not containing certain semantic pattern" are consistent. Hence semantics are canonical under sliding block code equivalence classes.

**Proof**: Directly from topological conjugacy property of Postulate A6. $\square$

---

## §5 Construction Paradigms

### 5.1 History-Freezing

Use vertical pairing to encode "$t \to t+1$" as local consistency; e.g., in $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$ SFT, constrain each cell to match $f$-evolution with its "below".

### 5.2 Sync Layer (Clock/Phase)

Embed phase field in pattern (alphabet $\{0,\dots,k-1\}$), making remote dependencies rewritten as adjacent layer consistency; interface protocol: phase increments mod $k$, moat resets on conflicts.

### 5.3 Moat

Achieve stable interface with exterior via isolation band of width $O(r)$, using fixed pattern to absorb phase conflicts and local defects; defect absorption strategy: majority vote or error correction code. (State $Q \times \{0,1\}$, 1 for interior, 0 for exterior.)

### 5.4 Fault-Tolerant Redundancy

Multi-track majority vote/spatiotemporal repetition encoding, ensuring long-range stability; e.g., triple-track redundancy, each track independently simulates, output takes majority.

### 5.5 Self-Similar Macroblock

Scaled auditing (hierarchical checker) writes "whether carrying computation" into macroblock matching; adopt Mozes tiling, self-similar scale recursively checks lower-level consistency.

### 5.6 Prefix Loading

Adopt prefix-free boxing for "code+data", naturally achieving $2^{-|p|}$ sampling weight; mechanism: universal interpreter reads prefix code, independent of background measure.

---

## §6 Observation Semantics and "Semantic Collapse"

### Definition 6.1 (Observation Step)

Choose window $W$ and decoder $\pi$, obtain output string and state label (halt/acc/step).

### Definition 6.2 (Observation Equivalence Class)

Define equivalence relation $\sim_\pi$: $\mathcal{B}_1 \sim_\pi \mathcal{B}_2$ if for all windows $W$, $\pi(\mathcal{B}_1 \upharpoonright W) = \pi(\mathcal{B}_2 \upharpoonright W)$. Equivalence class $[\mathcal{B}]_\pi$ is observation equivalence class.

### Proposition 6.1 (Semantic Collapse)

Relative to given $\pi$, "observation" partitions the same underlying structure family into semantic equivalence classes; one concrete observation selects a representative of one equivalence class (readable interpretation). Semantic collapse is selection functor: choosing $\Pi(\mathcal{B}) \in [\mathcal{B}]_\pi$.

**Remark 6.1 (Distinction from Standard Factor Maps)**: Distinguished from topological invariance of standard SFT factor maps, this semantic collapse emphasizes observer-relative selection framework, providing partition logic for semantic equivalence classes. **Important Clarification**: This "collapse" is a **mathematical/observational terminology**, meaning observation behavior selects a representative in equivalence class, **not a physical process**, only involving decoding choice, not altering underlying static blocks.

### Corollary 6.2 (Essence of Observation)

In closed universe, observation doesn't "change" legal blocks, only selects readable structural path; "observation=decoding≈semantic collapse".

**Proof**: Directly from Definition 6.1 and Proposition 6.1. $\square$

---

## §7 Categorical Semantics

### 7.1 Basic Categorical Structure

**Objects**: Legal static blocks $\mathcal{B}$.

**Morphisms**: Local factor maps/sliding block codes (preserving local consistency).

**Observation Functor**: $\Pi: \mathsf{SFT} \to \mathsf{Str}$ (finite word category), $\Pi(\mathcal{B}) = \{\pi(\mathcal{B} \upharpoonright W)\}$. Observation functor realizes semantic collapse by selecting equivalence class $[\mathcal{B}]_\pi$.

**Decoding Natural Isomorphism**: If two decoders $\pi_1, \pi_2$ differ by bijective sliding block code $\tau$, there exists natural isomorphism $\eta: \Pi_{\pi_1} \to \Pi_{\pi_2}$ such that $\Pi_{\pi_2}(\mathcal{B}) = \tau \circ \Pi_{\pi_1}(\mathcal{B})$. This corresponds to natural isomorphism on fibers.

**Sliding Block Code Fibers and Grothendieck Transformation**: On observation layer, take sliding block code equivalence classes as fibers; decoding invariance allows fibration construction, with Grothendieck transformation characterizing fibers above different decoders.

**Remark 7.1 (Categorical Properties)**: Category not specified as Cartesian closed, but has fibration structure.

---

## §8 Examples and Templates

### 8.1 Universal Substrate Pattern

2D SFT / 1D CA history-freezing embedding (e.g., Rule 110 embedding TM adder: track simulates tape and head, moat width 3, following 5.1–5.6).

### 8.2 Program Box Blueprint

Four-layer structure: center—clock ring—moat—outer sea; outer sea can be any compliant background.

### 8.3 Forced Carrying Case

Macroblock auditor checks lower-level consistency and "computational traces" at each layer, adopting Gács hierarchical redundancy.

---

### Proposition 9.0 (Moore-Myhill and Information Conservation)

On CA over amenable groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$), if no Garden-of-Eden then global map is pre-injective. The Kolmogorov upper bound (A5) of "information not created from nothing" in this framework is consistent with this topological-combinatorial invariant: pre-injectivity ensures inverse image existence, complementing information conservation upper bound, but differing in that the bound focuses on algorithmic complexity rather than mere existence.

**Amenable Group Assumption**: In this paper's setting, $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$ automatically satisfies amenability, Moore-Myhill theorem directly applies.

**Complementary Rather Than Implicative**: The relationship between pre-injectivity and A5 is **complementary rather than implicative**: pre-injectivity guarantees topological-level no information loss (global reversibility), A5 guarantees algorithmic-level information non-growth (complexity upper bound). Both jointly support closed universe's information conservation framework.

**Proof**: Moore (1962) and Myhill (1963) proved no Garden-of-Eden ⇔ pre-injective; in information-theoretic context, pre-injectivity guarantees no information loss, consistency with Brudno upper bound from finiteness of local rules. $\square$

- **Gács**'s hierarchical self-organizing simulation ensures fault tolerance
- **Hedlund (1969)** / Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem standardizes decoders

- **Solomonoff/Levin** prior guides typical emergence
- **Cook 2004** and **Neary–Woods 2006** provide Rule 110 universality and polynomial simulation
- **Burton–Steif 1994** provide measure non-uniqueness counterexample

## §10 Conclusion and Outlook

### 10.1 Main Contributions

This theory, in the context of closed universes, establishes unified framework of "computation=structure, observation=decoding, time=index". We proved program emergence existence, two implementation paths of forced/typical, $\Sigma_1^0 / \Pi_2^0$ decidability hierarchy, and information conservation conditional complexity upper bound, characterizing decoding invariance and observation logic with categorical semantics.

### 10.2 Theoretical Positioning

This framework is both self-consistent and naturally couples with broader "collapse-aware" perspective: observation doesn't change universe, only changes readability; semantic choice is "collapse" choice. Thus, dynamic narrative of computation is reduced to geometric/combinatorial facts in static body, program "occurrence" becomes structural event in legal static block space.

### 10.3 Future Directions

**Short-term**: Moat overhead optimization, mixing threshold research, forced family expression boundary exploration.

**Long-term**: Measure uniqueness research, global recycling and reversibility, connection with quantum computing framework.

## Appendix A: Formalized Moat Definition and block-gluing Verification

### A.1 Metric and Causal Envelope

Take $\ell_\infty$ distance on $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$. Given finite window $U \subset \Lambda \times T$, its causal past envelope $\mathrm{Past}_r(U)$ is defined as minimal closure backward-tracing $r$-neighborhood.

### A.2 Moat Disjointness Lemma

Let moat width $m \ge 2r + 1$. If two blocks $P_1, P_2$ have $\ell_\infty$ support distance $\ge m$, then $\mathrm{Past}_r(P_1) \cap \mathrm{Past}_r(P_2) = \varnothing$.

**Proof**: Causal past envelope $\mathrm{Past}_r(U)$ defined as minimal set backward-tracing $r$ steps from $U$. Moat width $m$ ensures buffer between two blocks at least $m$ cells, after tracing $r$ steps still disjoint (distance at least $m - 2r \ge 1$). $\square$

### A.3 Independent Gluing Lemma

If $\mathrm{Past}_r(P_1) \cap \mathrm{Past}_r(P_2) = \varnothing$, then CHL local consistency can be decomposed into independent checks for $P_1$ and $P_2$; moat's fixed absorbing state (e.g., all-0) guarantees cross-boundary defects annihilated within $O(r)$ steps.

**Proof**: Causal disjointness ensures no shared past state, hence local constraints locally verifiable. Fixed state absorbs defects similar to buffers in circuits: defect signal propagation speed $\le r$ steps/cell, stabilizes in width $m$ moat. $\square$

**Proposition A.3′ (Defect Absorption Condition)**: If system has global absorbing sub-alphabet or safe symbol layer satisfying CHL absorption closure, then fixed absorbing state guarantees defects annihilated within $O(r)$ steps. Lacking this structure, only almost-specification: gluing holds with exponentially decaying failure probability.

### A.4 Conclusion: c-block-gluing

There exists constant $c = c(m, r, Q)$ such that when support distance $\ge c$, two blocks can be glued into global legal configuration via moat mediation. Specifically $c \le m + 2r$, corresponding to linear-gap version of quantified block-gluing (failure probability exponentially small, degrading to almost-specification if lacking complete block-gluing).

**Report**: Compression ratio curve on history-freezing Rule-110-SFT aligns with known $h_\mu$ estimate; error bars from window selection and phase field.

### Reproducible Experimental Parameter Table

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|------|-----|------|
| Window Size Sequence | 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 | Cube $n \times n \times \Delta t$ |
| Sampling Step $\Delta t$ | $n/4$ | Time depth scales with spatial scale |
| Boundary Handling | Periodic / Fixed Padding | Run both for comparison |
| Compressor | LZ-77 (zlib 1.2.11) / PPMd (H variant) | Dictionary 32KB, sliding window 8KB |
| Compressor Parameters | zlib: level=9; PPMd: order=6, mem=16MB | Maximal compression config |
| Independent Run Count | 100 | Random seed sampling per size |
| Serialization Order | Row-major (x → y → t) | Window flattened to 1D sequence |
| Alphabet Encoding | Direct binary (1 bit/state) | Rule 110 states{0,1} |

**Random Seed Control**: Each round uses independent random initial slice (uniform distribution), computing compression rate mean and standard deviation. Edge effects quantified by comparing periodic/fixed boundaries.

## Appendix C: Open Problems

### C.1 Minimal Moat Overhead

Given steady-state duration $T$, what is minimal box thickness/redundancy achieving extendability?

### C.2 Mixing Threshold

Under what perturbation/defect density does decoding remain robust?

### C.3 Expression Boundary of Forced Families

What higher-order properties can self-similar constructions force without global invariants?

### C.4 Measure Uniqueness

Is internal maximal entropy measure unique? (2D SFT typically non-unique; unique under 1D primitive edge matrix, Parry measure.) If not, how do typicality conclusions vary with measure families?

### C.5 Global Recycling and Reversibility

In reversible CA substrate, what are bounds of "reversible readback" for semantic collapse?
