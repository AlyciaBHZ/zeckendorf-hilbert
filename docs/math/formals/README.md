# Zeckendorf-Hilbert Formal Verification Project

## Project Overview

This directory contains the complete formal verification of the Zeckendorf-Hilbert mathematical theory using the Coq proof assistant. The project implements a **Zero Admitted Policy** where all theorems must have complete proofs ending with `Qed`, ensuring mathematical rigor and completeness.

## Architecture

### Layered Verification Structure

The formal verification follows a strict dependency hierarchy that mirrors the mathematical theory structure:

```
Foundations/     → A1 Axiom, Basic Notations, Fibonacci, φ-language
    ↓
Structures/      → Language Encoding, Automata, Initial Algebra  
    ↓
Advanced/        → Dynamic Programming, Hilbert Tower, Tensor Laws
    ↓
Deep/           → Spectral Decomposition, Continuous Limits, Entropy Rate
    ↓
Meta/           → Category Theory, Algorithm Verification, Circular Completeness
    ↓
Main/           → Integration Theorems, Complete System Verification
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Complete Bijective Equivalence**: Every concept in `docs/math/` has a corresponding formal definition
2. **Zero Admitted Policy**: No `Admitted` statements allowed; all proofs complete with `Qed`
3. **Pure Binary Implementation**: All binary operations use native Coq implementations, not strings
4. **Incremental Compilation**: Each layer builds on previous layers without circular dependencies
5. **Theory Correspondence**: Direct mapping between informal theory and formal verification

## Theory Correspondence Verification

### Mapping to Mathematical Theory

| Mathematical Document | Formal Verification Files | Key Theorems |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| `00-basic-notation.md` | `Foundations/BasicNotations.v` | Notation consistency |
| `01-language-encoding.md` | `Structures/LanguageEncoding.v` | φ-language completeness |
| `02-automata-system.md` | `Structures/TwoStateAutomaton.v` | Automaton correctness |
| `05-hilbert-tower.md` | `Advanced/HilbertTower.v` | Quantum space construction |
| `10-categorical-equivalence.md` | `Meta/CategoricalEquivalence.v` | Universe bijection |

### Bijection Verification Protocol

1. **Structural Correspondence**: Every mathematical definition has formal counterpart
2. **Theorem Preservation**: Every informal theorem becomes formal theorem with proof
3. **Computational Realizability**: All algorithms in theory are extractable from formal proofs
4. **Consistency Check**: No contradictions between informal and formal versions

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Theorems
1. Identify corresponding position in layered architecture
2. Add formal statement to appropriate `.v` file  
3. Develop complete proof (no `Admitted` allowed)
4. Update dependency chain if needed
5. Verify compilation of dependent files

### Proof Development Standards
- Use structured proof scripts (bullets, braces)
- Document complex proof steps with comments
- Prefer constructive proofs when possible
- Use automation (auto, tauto, omega) judiciously
- Maintain readability for mathematical review

### Binary Implementation Requirements
- Use `nat`, `Z`, `bool` for all binary representations
- Implement string concatenation via list operations
- Use `Vector.t bool n` for fixed-length binary strings
- Avoid `String.string` type entirely
- Implement bit operations using native Coq functions

## Quality Assurance

### Continuous Integration Checks
1. **Compilation**: All files must compile without errors
2. **Zero Admitted**: No `Admitted` statements in any proof
3. **Dependency Integrity**: No circular dependencies between layers
4. **Theory Correspondence**: All mathematical concepts formalized
5. **Extraction Success**: All algorithms extract to runnable code

### Mathematical Review Process
1. **Proof Correctness**: Each theorem proof independently verified
2. **Consistency**: No contradictory theorems across files
3. **Completeness**: All major results from informal theory proven
4. **Efficiency**: Proof search terminates in reasonable time

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion, this formal verification will provide:

1. **Mathematical Certainty**: Computer-verified proofs of all major theorems
2. **Computational Implementation**: Extracted algorithms for numerical verification
3. **Theory Validation**: Confirmation of consistency in the informal mathematical theory
4. **Research Foundation**: Solid basis for further theoretical development

The formal verification serves as both a validation of the existing mathematical theory and a foundation for extending the Zeckendorf-Hilbert framework to new domains.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Compilation Issues
- **Universe inconsistency**: May require adjusting polymorphism settings
- **Library not found**: Install missing Coq packages via opam
- **Circular dependency**: Check file order in `_CoqProject`
- **Proof timeout**: Increase memory limits or optimize proof scripts

### Performance Optimization
- Use `Set Bullet Behavior "Strict Subproofs"` for structured proofs
- Enable `Set Primitive Projections` for record types
- Consider `Set Universe Polymorphism` for generic constructions
- Use `Timeout` tactics for bounded proof search
