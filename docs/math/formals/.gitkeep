# Formal verification directory structure
# This directory contains the complete Coq formalization of Zeckendorf-Hilbert theory
# Organized in phases to ensure bijective equivalence with mathematical theory

## Directory Structure:
# Foundations/  - Core axioms and basic constructions
# Structures/   - Language encoding and automata systems  
# Advanced/     - Dynamic programming and Hilbert towers
# Deep/         - Spectral decomposition and entropy theory
# Meta/         - Categorical equivalence and completeness
# Main/         - Integration theorems and final proofs
