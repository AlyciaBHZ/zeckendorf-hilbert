(** * The Fundamental Binary Bit Type *)

(**
 * PhiBit: The pure binary character type
 * Corresponds to mathematical notation: Σ = {0, 1}
 *)
Inductive PhiBit : Type := 
  | zero  (* represents mathematical 0 *)
  | one.  (* represents mathematical 1 *)

(** * Basic PhiBit Operations *)

(**
 * Equality test for PhiBit (computable)
 *)
Definition phi_bit_eq (b1 b2 : PhiBit) : bool :=
  match b1, b2 with
  | zero, zero => true
  | one, one => true
  | _, _ => false
  end.

(**
 * PhiBit equality is decidable
 *)
Theorem phi_bit_eq_decidable : forall (b1 b2 : PhiBit), {b1 = b2} + {b1 <> b2}.
Proof.
  intros b1 b2.
  destruct b1, b2; 
  [left; reflexivity | right; discriminate | 
   right; discriminate | left; reflexivity].
Qed.

(**
 * phi_bit_eq is correct (reflects actual equality)
 *)
Theorem phi_bit_eq_correct : forall (b1 b2 : PhiBit),
  phi_bit_eq b1 b2 = true <-> b1 = b2.
Proof.
  intros b1 b2.
  split.
  - intro H.
    destruct b1, b2; simpl in H; try discriminate H; reflexivity.
  - intro H.
    rewrite H.
    destruct b2; reflexivity.
Qed.

(**
 * PhiBit has exactly two elements
 *)
Theorem phi_bit_two_elements : forall (b : PhiBit), b = zero \/ b = one.
Proof.
  intro b.
  destruct b; [left; reflexivity | right; reflexivity].
Qed.

(**
 * zero and one are distinct
 *)
Theorem phi_bit_zero_one_distinct : zero <> one.
Proof.
  discriminate.
Qed.

(**
 * Computational verification
 *)
Example phi_bit_examples :
  phi_bit_eq zero zero = true /\
  phi_bit_eq one one = true /\
  phi_bit_eq zero one = false /\
  phi_bit_eq one zero = false.
Proof.
  repeat split; reflexivity.
Qed.

 * Module Summary:
 * 
 * This PhiBitType module provides the atomic foundation for all binary
 * operations in the Zeckendorf-Hilbert formal verification project.
 * 
 * Key Properties:
 * ✓ Single theorem focus: PhiBit type and basic equality operations
 * ✓ Zero dependencies: Only uses Coq standard library
 * ✓ Complete proofs: All theorems end with Qed
 * ✓ Computational verification: All operations are computable
 * ✓ Pure binary implementation: No string or other complex type dependencies
 * 
 * This atomic module can be safely imported by any other module requiring
 * binary bit operations, with zero risk of compilation errors or circular dependencies.
