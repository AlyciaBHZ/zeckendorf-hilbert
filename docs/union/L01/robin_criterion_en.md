# Robin Criterion (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Statement (recorded in the union)
For $n > 5040$,
$$
\sigma(n) < e^{\gamma}\,n\,\log\!\log n,
$$
where $\gamma$ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.
An equivalent form recorded in the project is
$$
\frac{\sigma(n)}{n\,\log\!\log n} < e^{\gamma}\qquad (n\ge 5041).
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- The union records Robin’s inequality in the canonical forms used by the project; constants and thresholds are kept in full.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-riemann-hypothesis-holographic-proof.md` (Robin inequality section) for the $\sigma(n) < e^{\gamma} n\log\log n$ statement.
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-rh-equivalences-experimental-comprehensive.md` (Sec. 5.2 and Table A3.2) for the $\sigma(n)/(n\log\log n) < e^{\gamma}$ form and numeric validations.
