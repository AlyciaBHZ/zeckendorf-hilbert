## Boundary Entropy Inequality (canonical in this union)
For boundary intervals $[t_{1},t_{2}]$ on the critical line,
$$
S_{\partial}\big[ t_{1}, t_{2} \big] \ \le \ \ln(3)\,\left| t_{2} - t_{1} \right|.
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This canonical bound is recorded as a boundary–information constraint used in RH‑related statements; it references L00 triadic forms for entropy components.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite non‑summary pages where boundary/entropy constraints are developed in the project: `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-information-triadic-balance.md` (entropy components) and `docs/zeta/zeta-riemann-hypothesis-holographic-proof.md` (RH‑context derivations), together with `docs/zeta-publish/zeta-quantum-classical-phase-transition.md` (boundary‑information context).
- Any use of $S_{\partial}$ should tie back to L00 triadic components and their definitions (`docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md`).
