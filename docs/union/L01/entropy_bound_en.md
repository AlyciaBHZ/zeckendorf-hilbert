## Boundary Entropy Inequality (canonical in this union)
For boundary intervals $[t_{1},t_{2}]$ on the critical line,
$$
S_{\partial}\big[ t_{1}, t_{2} \big] \ \le \ \ln(3)\,\left| t_{2} - t_{1} \right|.
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This canonical bound is recorded as a boundary–information constraint used in RH‑related statements; it references L00 triadic forms for entropy components.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- The inequality must cite the canonical RH equivalence sources admitted by the project (e.g., `docs/zeta_rh_equivalences.md`) and keep the formula unabridged.
- Any use of $S_{\partial}$ should be accompanied by definitions tied to L00 triadic information components (see `docs/zeta_theorems.md`).
