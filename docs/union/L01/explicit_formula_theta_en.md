## Canonical Form (recorded in the union)
For Chebyshev’s theta function $\theta(x)=\sum_{p\le x}\log p$, the explicit formula can be written in a canonical variant involving non‑trivial zeros $\rho$ of $\zeta(s)$ and lower‑order terms; schematically,
$$
\theta(x) = x - \sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho} + \text{(lower‑order terms)}.
$$
All grouping/terms must follow the admitted source document precisely.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This page stores a canonical variant for $\theta(x)$ to avoid restating it elsewhere; bounds and lower‑order terms must be cited as in the source.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` for the project‑admitted explicit‑formula entries where $\theta(x)$ appears.
