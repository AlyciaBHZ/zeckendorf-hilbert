## Canonical Form (recorded in the union)
For Chebyshev’s theta function $\theta(x)=\sum_{p\le x}\log p$, a canonical explicit‑formula variant recorded by the project is
$$
\theta(x) = x - \sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho} - \log(2\pi) - \frac{1}{2}\,\log\!\left(1 - x^{-2}\right),
$$
where $\rho$ ranges over non‑trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$. Grouping and constants follow the admitted source document.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This page stores a canonical variant for $\theta(x)$ to avoid restating it elsewhere; bounds and lower‑order terms must be cited as in the source.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-holographic-encoding-prime-infinity.md` (canonical $\vartheta/\theta$ explicit‑formula entry in the project) and `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` (grouping conventions).
