# Log-Derivative of $\zeta$ (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Canonical Identities (for $\operatorname{Re}(s)>1$)
Dirichlet series for the logarithmic derivative:
$$
-\,\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}},\qquad \operatorname{Re}(s) > 1,
$$
with $\Lambda(n)$ the von Mangoldt function.

## Canonical Partial-Fraction Type Relation (recorded in the union)
In terms of zeros and poles, one writes schematically
$$
\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{\rho} \frac{1}{s-\rho} + \text{(pole/trivial-zero terms)}\,\,+\,\text{(regular part)},
$$
with convergence and grouping handled canonically as in the admitted sources.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- The Dirichlet‑series identity and the zero/pole expansion are recorded for use in explicit‑formula derivations; all groupings follow the source.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` for the Dirichlet‑series identity and grouping conventions.
- When combined with explicit formula, cite L01/explicit_formula_variants_en.md and L00 foundations.
