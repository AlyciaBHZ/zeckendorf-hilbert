# Lagarias Criterion (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Statement (recorded in the union)
For all integers $n \ge 1$,
$$
\sigma(n) < H_{n} + e^{H_{n}}\,\log H_{n},
$$
where $\sigma(n)=\sum_{d\mid n} d$ is the sum of divisors and $H_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}$ is the $n$‑th harmonic number.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- The union records the Lagarias inequality as a canonical RH equivalence in arithmetic‑function form without abbreviation; bounds and constants are kept verbatim.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-self-reference-riemann-unprovability.md` (Chapter 10, Lagarias equivalence) for the explicit inequality and context.
- Supplement with `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-rh-equivalences-experimental-comprehensive.md` (table A3.1) where the project catalogs this equivalence; keep the inequality exactly as stated in the source.
