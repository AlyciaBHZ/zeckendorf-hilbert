# Zero-free Region (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Statement
There exists an absolute constant $c>0$ such that $\zeta(s) \ne 0$ in the region
$$
\sigma \ge 1 - \frac{c}{\log\!\left( |t| + 3 \right)}\,,\qquad s=\sigma+it,\ \ t\in\mathbb{R}.
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This is a canonical zero‑free region near $\sigma=1$; in the union it is recorded to constrain locations of zeros for use in explicit‑formula and counting arguments.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Zero‑free region statements must cite the canonical references admitted by the project as indexed in `docs/zeta_theorems.md`, and are to be used together with the completed functional equation and explicit‑formula entries.
