## Canonical Statement
Let $f$ be meromorphic and nonzero on the boundary of a domain $D$ with positively oriented boundary $\partial D$. Then
$$
\frac{1}{2\,\pi i}\,\oint_{\partial D} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz = N_{D} - P_{D},
$$
where $N_{D}$ and $P_{D}$ denote, respectively, the number of zeros and poles of $f$ in $D$, counted with multiplicity.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- The canonical argument principle is recorded to support zero‑counting derivations; all hypotheses (meromorphicity, boundary nonvanishing, orientation) must be respected.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta-publish/riemann-hypothesis-topological-necessity.md` where the argument principle is invoked in the project’s non‑summary text.
- For zero counting of $\zeta$, pair with L01/riemann_von_mangoldt_en.md and the explicit‑formula entries under `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md`.
