# Poisson Summation (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Statement
For a sufficiently nice function $f$ and its Fourier transform $\hat{f}$,
$$
\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} f(n) = \sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}} \hat{f}(2\pi k),
$$
with hypotheses as stated in the admitted sources; this identity is used in analytic continuations and explicit‑formula derivations.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- Poisson summation is recorded canonically for cross‑referencing analytic transforms; usage must keep domain conditions and normalizations consistent with the source.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-analytic-continuation-chaos.md` for the project‑admitted Poisson‑summation usage and normalizations.
