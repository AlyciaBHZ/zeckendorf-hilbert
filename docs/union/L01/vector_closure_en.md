## Closure Conditions at Zeros (canonical)
From $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-s}$ and $n^{-s} = n^{-\sigma}\,e^{-i t \log n}$, a zero $\zeta(s)=0$ implies
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-\sigma}\,\cos\!\left( t\,\log n \right) = 0,\qquad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-\sigma}\,\sin\!\left( t\,\log n \right) = 0.
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- These are canonical closure equalities encoding real/imaginary parts of the Dirichlet series at zeros; used by RH‑related arguments.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite canonical pages that state the closure conditions (e.g., `docs/zeta_theorems.md`, `docs/zeta_rh_equivalences.md`) and keep both sums in full.
- Any geometric/topological reformulation of the closure must remain a multi‑view note and cite this canonical form.
