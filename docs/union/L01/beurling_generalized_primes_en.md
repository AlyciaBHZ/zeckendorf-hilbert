# Beurling Generalized Primes (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md
- L00 · ../L00/hilbert_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
Generalized prime systems $\mathbb{P}^{(k)}$ and associated counting functions are used in the project’s non‑summary texts to express recursive structures and zeta–duality; the union records the canonical notations without alteration.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This page stores the canonical Beurling/generalized–primes vocabulary referenced by equivalence chains in the project; all asymptotics and identities must be cited from original sources below.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-generalized-primes-strange-loop-equivalence.md` for project‑admitted generalized‑prime statements and their relation to zeta duality.
- Cite `docs/zeta_rh_equivalences.md` where generalized‑prime equivalences are discussed in the project’s non‑summary materials.
