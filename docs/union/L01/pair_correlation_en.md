# Pair Correlation (Canonical; Full Forms Used in the Union)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Form Used Here
The pair correlation function for normalized zeros is recorded as
$$
R_{2}(x) = 1 - \left( \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \right)^{2},
$$
consistent with GUE phenomenology recorded in the union’s canonical entries.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This page canonically records the pair‑correlation form used alongside GUE spacing; it serves as a reference point for zero‑statistics arguments.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta-publish/zeta-quantum-classical-phase-transition.md` and `docs/zeta/zeta-prime-distribution-random-matrix.md` for pair‑correlation and RMT entries (non‑summary).
- When used with $Z(t)$ or explicit formulas, cite the original sources `docs/zeta-publish/zeta-critical-line-appendix.md` and `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` respectively; keep the L00 explicit‑formula dependency explicit.
