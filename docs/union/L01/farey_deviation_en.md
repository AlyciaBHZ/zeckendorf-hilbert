## Canonical Statements (recorded in the union)
A project‑recorded RH‑equivalent bound for Farey deviations includes forms such as
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{m_n} d_{k,n}^{2} = O\!\left(n^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)\quad (\forall\,\varepsilon>0),
$$
or an $L^{1}$‑type condition
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{m_n} \| d_{k,n} \| = O\!\left(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}\right)\quad (\forall\,\varepsilon>0).
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- The union stores canonical asymptotic bounds used in the project to express RH in the Farey‑deviation language; constants and orders are kept as recorded.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-rh-equivalences-experimental-comprehensive.md` (row G4.2 Farey sequence deviation) where these forms are cataloged by the project.
