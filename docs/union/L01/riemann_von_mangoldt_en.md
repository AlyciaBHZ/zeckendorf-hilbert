## Canonical Forms (recorded in the union)
Counting non‑trivial zeros $\rho=\tfrac{1}{2}+i\,\gamma$ with $0<\gamma\le T$:
$$
N(T) = \frac{T}{2\,\pi}\,\log\!\left(\frac{T}{2\,\pi}\right) - \frac{T}{2\,\pi} + O\!\left(\log T\right),
$$
and equivalently,
$$
N(T) = \frac{T}{2\,\pi}\,\log\!\left(\frac{T}{2\,\pi e}\right) + O\!\left(\log T\right).
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- These canonical zero‑counting forms are recorded for upper‑layer spacing and explicit‑formula arguments; keep them unabridged.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` for the admitted canonical zero‑counting entries.
