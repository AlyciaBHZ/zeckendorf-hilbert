## Canonical Variant (recorded in the union)
For $\psi(x)$, one variant emphasizes the sum over non‑trivial zeros with terms grouped canonically:
$$
\psi(x) = x - \sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho} - \log(2\pi) - \frac{1}{2}\,\log\!\left(1 - x^{-2}\right),
$$
with trivial‑zero and pole contributions recorded as the logarithmic terms.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This page stores canonical variants of the explicit formula to avoid restating them elsewhere; use as the anchor for prime‑oscillation arguments.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` (explicit‑formula components and grouping) and `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-analytic-continuation-chaos.md` (equivalent forms under analytic continuation).
- Keep logarithmic terms, trivial zeros and pole contributions exactly as in the source; no abbreviation or reshuffling.
