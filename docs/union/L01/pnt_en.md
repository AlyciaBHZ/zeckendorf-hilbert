## Canonical Statements
Let $\pi(x)$ denote the prime‑counting function, and $\psi(x)$ Chebyshev’s function.
$$
\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}\qquad (x\to\infty),
$$
$$
\psi(x) \sim x\qquad (x\to\infty).
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- These are canonical asymptotic statements recorded for alignment with explicit‑formula expressions; details remain in the original sources and are not altered here.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite non‑summary entries: `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` (explicit‑formula and Chebyshev/von‑Mangoldt context) and `docs/zeta/zeta-prime-distribution-random-matrix.md` (PNT background section); use together with the explicit formula recorded in L01/L00.
