# Prime Number Theorem (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Statements
Let $\pi(x)$ denote the prime‑counting function, and $\psi(x)$ Chebyshev’s function.
$$
\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}\qquad (x\to\infty),
$$
$$
\psi(x) \sim x\qquad (x\to\infty).
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- These are canonical asymptotic statements recorded for alignment with explicit‑formula expressions; details remain in the original sources and are not altered here.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- PNT statements must cite the canonical entries admitted by the project under `docs/zeta_theorems.md` (and any designated references), and are to be used together with the explicit formula stated in L01/L00.
