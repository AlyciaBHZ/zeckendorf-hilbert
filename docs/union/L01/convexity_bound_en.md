# Convexity Bound for $\zeta(s)$ (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Statement (Phragmén–Lindelöf/convexity type)
For $0 \le \sigma \le 1$ and any $\varepsilon>0$,
$$
\zeta(\sigma+it) \ \ll_{\varepsilon}\ (|t|+3)^{\,\frac{1-\sigma}{2}+\varepsilon}.
$$
The implied constant depends on $\varepsilon$.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This bound is recorded canonically for use in analytic estimates of sums and integrals; it is used with completed‑function symmetry and explicit‑formula entries without altering source statements.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- The convexity‑type bound must cite the admitted canonical references in `docs/zeta_theorems.md` (and designated analytic‑number‑theory sources), alongside the completed functional equation $\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)$.
