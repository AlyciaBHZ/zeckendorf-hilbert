## Canonical Integral Representation
For $\operatorname{Re}(s)>1$,
$$
\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{t^{s-1}}{e^{t}-1}\,dt.
$$
(See also canonical Poisson‑summation routes admitted by the project.)

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This page stores the canonical Mellin integral used to connect $\zeta(s)$ with analytic transforms; all usage must keep the integral and $\Gamma(s)$ factor intact.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-analytic-continuation-chaos.md` for the integral representation and $\Gamma$‑function identities involved.
- When combining with explicit formulas, cite L01/explicit_formula_variants_en.md and L00 Zeta foundations.
