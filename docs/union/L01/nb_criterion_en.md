## Canonical Statement
Let
$$
\rho_{\alpha}(x) = \left\{ \frac{\alpha}{x} \right\} - \alpha\,\left\{ \frac{1}{x} \right\},\qquad \alpha>0.
$$
Then RH holds if and only if the linear span
$$
\mathcal{B} = \operatorname{span}\Big\{ \rho_{\alpha}(x) : \alpha>0 \Big\}
$$
is dense in $L^{2}(0,1)$ under the constraint that $\sum_{k} c_{k}/\alpha_{k} = 0$ for finite linear combinations $\sum_{k} c_{k}\,\rho_{\alpha_{k}}(x)$.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This is a canonical functional‑analytic equivalence for RH; in the union it is recorded to align geometry–information forms without altering the statement.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite non‑summary NB discussions admitted by the project: `docs/pure-zeta/tphi-h5-five-fold-equivalence-theorem_en.md` (Beurling–Nyman density criterion context) and `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-strange-loop-recursive-closure.md` (L² approximation framing); keep the canonical statement in full.
- Any mapping to Hilbert embeddings must cite L00 Hilbert foundations and remain in multi‑view notes.
