## Canonical Reflection Formula
For $s\in\mathbb{C}$ not an integer,
$$
\Gamma(s)\,\Gamma(1-s) = \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi s)}.
$$

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- The reflection formula is recorded canonically for use with functional equations and analytic continuation; usage must keep the formula unabridged.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-analytic-continuation-chaos.md` where the reflection formula is employed in deriving the functional equation.
