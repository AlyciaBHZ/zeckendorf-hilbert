## Canonical Definitions (recorded in the union)
Let $E$ be a Hermite–Biehler entire function. The de Branges space $\mathcal{B}(E)$ consists of entire functions $F$ such that
- $F$ and $F^{\#}(z):=\overline{F(\overline{z})}$ belong to the Hardy space on the upper half–plane when divided by $E$ and $E^{\#}$ respectively;
- the norm is given canonically by
$$
\|F\|^{2}_{\mathcal{B}(E)} = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{|F(x)|^{2}}{|E(x)|^{2}}\,dx.
$$
A reality symmetry $F(z)=\overline{F(\overline{z})}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is recorded where applicable in the project sources.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- The union stores canonical de Branges/RKHS ingredients used in RH discussions. Statements are recorded verbatim; any claimed equivalences must cite the project’s non‑summary sources without restatement.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-self-referential-encoding-analysis.md` (Sec. 3.3 de Branges spaces) where the project introduces $\mathcal{B}(E)$ and RH relations.
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/tphi-h5-five-fold-equivalence-theorem_en.md` (de Branges/RKHS lane in the five‑fold chart) for the RKHS context used by the project.
