# Koopman–Spectral Chains (Canonical; Consolidated)

## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
Koopman operator $(\mathcal{K}f)(x)=f(Tx)$ on $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ with $T$ measure‑preserving is unitary on $L^{2}(\mu)$; spectral calculus proceeds via L00 Hilbert foundations. Canonical spectral decompositions and eigenfunction conditions are kept as in upstream pages.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This L02 node collects canonical Koopman/RKHS ingredients for spectral links appearing in the project’s RH context; formulas remain in L01/L00.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/traditional-math/riemann-hypothesis-unified-reorganized_en.md` (Koopman transfer operator and spectrum) for the non‑summary usage.
- Any mapping from Koopman spectra to zeta identities must cite L00/L01 canonical $\xi$ forms and Dirichlet/product identities (`docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md`).
