# Argument Principle Chain (Canonical; Consolidated)

## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
Argument principle with the logarithmic derivative $\zeta'(s)/\zeta(s)$ and zero counting $N(T)$ are recorded in L01; this L02 page aggregates these ingredients for zero‑location arguments.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- Use the argument principle together with log‑derivative and $N(T)$ to organize zero‑counting derivations; expressions remain in L01.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta-publish/riemann-hypothesis-topological-necessity.md` where the argument principle is invoked in non‑summary contexts, and `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` for log‑derivative and explicit‑formula entries.
