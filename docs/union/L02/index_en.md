# Layer L02

This layer consolidates canonical chains that depend on multiple L01 pages. By DAG rules, L02 may reference L01 and L00; same‑layer references are forbidden, and there must be no gaps in proof chains. All formulas are recorded in full (non‑abbreviated), and proof chains cite original files under `/docs/`.
