# de Branges Chain (Canonical; Consolidated)

## Dependencies (Upward)
- L01 · ../L01/de_branges_spaces_en.md
- L01 · ../L01/xi_hadamard_en.md
- L00 · ../L00/hilbert_foundations_en.md
- L00 · ../L00/zeta_foundations_en.md

## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
This page aggregates canonical de Branges/RKHS ingredients and the Hadamard product for $\xi(s)$ recorded in L01; expressions remain in the cited pages.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- Use RKHS structure and the $\xi$ Hadamard product as upstream anchors in functional‑analytic routes to RH; maintain canonical forms and source normalizations.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-self-referential-encoding-analysis.md` (de Branges) and `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` (Hadamard mention) as non‑summary sources admitted by the project.
