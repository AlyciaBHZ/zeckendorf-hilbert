## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
Arithmetic‑function criteria (Lagarias/Robin), combinatorial/geometric criteria (Farey deviations), and functional‑analytic criteria (Nyman–Beurling) are recorded in their own L01 pages; this L02 page consolidates them for cross‑use in RH contexts without restating formulas.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This page provides an L02 aggregation node to feed upper‑layer chains; all expressions remain in the L01 pages. Use this page to reference the set of classical criteria in one place.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite L01 pages for the canonical statements; for project non‑summary context, cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-rh-equivalences-experimental-comprehensive.md` where these criteria are jointly cataloged.
