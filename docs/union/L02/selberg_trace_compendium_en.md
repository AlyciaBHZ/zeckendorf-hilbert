# Selberg Trace Compendium (Canonical; Full Forms)

## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
Canonical trace identity used in the project’s non‑summary pages:
$$
\operatorname{Tr} K(t) = \sum_{n} e^{-\lambda_{n} t} = \sum_{\gamma} \frac{\ell_{\gamma}}{\sqrt{\|\det(I - P_{\gamma})\|}}\, e^{-\ell_{\gamma}^{2}/(4 t)},
$$
where $\{\lambda_{n}\}$ are Laplacian eigenvalues and the right‑hand sum ranges over closed geodesics $\gamma$ with lengths $\ell_{\gamma}$ and linearized Poincaré maps $P_{\gamma}$.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- This compendium stores the canonical trace formula used to relate spectra and periodic orbits in the project; it serves as a bridge to spectral/geometry dualities referenced by higher layers without altering expressions.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-holographic-hilbert-completeness.md` (Sec. 17.2; Selberg/Lefschetz trace identities recorded by the project) and `docs/zeta/zeta-quantum-interpretation.md` (trace‑formula applications) as non‑summary sources.
