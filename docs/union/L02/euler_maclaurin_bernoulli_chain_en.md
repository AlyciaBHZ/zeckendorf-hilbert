# Euler–Maclaurin–Bernoulli Chain (Canonical; Consolidated)

## Dependencies (Upward)

## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
Euler–Maclaurin with Bernoulli numbers and $\zeta(-n)$ values (including trivial zeros) are recorded in L01; this page aggregates them for approximation/regularization contexts used by the project.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- Use canonical Euler–Maclaurin with remainder and Bernoulli values to organize asymptotic expansions consistently with project sources.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-analytic-continuation-chaos.md` for Euler–Maclaurin usage and remainder.
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` for Bernoulli generating functions and negative values $\zeta(-n)$.
