# Gamma–Stirling–Functional Chain (Canonical; Consolidated)

## Canonical Entries (recorded in the union)
The reflection formula for $\Gamma$, Stirling asymptotics, and the (completed/non‑completed) functional equations recorded in L01 are used jointly in analytic‑continuation arguments; this page aggregates them without altering expressions.

## Dense Summary (non‑canonical)
- Use reflection + Stirling to control $\Gamma$ factors and phases entering the functional equation and $\theta(t)$ asymptotics; keep canonical hypotheses and sectors.

## Proof chain bullets (from original sources; upward only)
- Cite `docs/pure-zeta/zeta-analytic-continuation-chaos.md` for reflection/Stirling usage in functional‑equation derivations.
- Cite `docs/zeta/zeta-series-product-analysis.md` where needed for background identities.
