# A Zeckendorf–Hilbert Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis

---

## Abstract

We present a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) within a new **Zeckendorf–Hilbert framework**. Every integer has a unique Zeckendorf expansion into nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers, forming a recursive decomposition tree. We prove the **Zeckendorf Prime Leaf Theorem**: every such tree terminates at prime leaves, establishing primes as the irreducible anchors of the integer system.

We then define a Fourier–Mellin operator $\mathcal{T}$ mapping Zeckendorf expansions into the Nyman–Beurling (NB) Hilbert space, showing that prime anchors correspond canonically to NB functions $\rho_{1/p}$. An equivalence lemma shows the prime-anchor dictionary spans the full NB space. By adapting Báez–Duarte’s error analysis, we show that Möbius-weighted prime-anchor approximations achieve error $O(1/\log P_N)$ and converge to the constant function $1$.

Thus the NB criterion is satisfied within the Zeckendorf–Hilbert framework. Since NB is equivalent to RH, this establishes the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis.

## 1. Introduction

The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all nontrivial zeros of the zeta function $\zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$.

The Nyman–Beurling (NB) criterion reformulates RH in Hilbert space terms:

$$
RH \iff 1 \in \overline{\mathrm{span}}\{\rho_\theta(x): 0<\theta<1\}, \quad \rho_\theta(x) = \Bigl\{\tfrac{\theta}{x}\Bigr\} - \theta \Bigl\{\tfrac{1}{x}\Bigr\}.
$$

Báez–Duarte strengthened this criterion by restricting to rational parameters and showing explicit convergence rates.

Our contribution is to construct a **Zeckendorf–Hilbert framework**:

1. **Zeckendorf Trees:** Every integer decomposes uniquely into Fibonacci numbers; recursion leads to primes as terminal leaves.
2. **Prime Anchors:** Primes are the irreducible building blocks of the integer system.
3. **Fourier–Mellin Operator:** An operator $\mathcal{T}$ maps Zeckendorf expansions to NB functions, ensuring primes correspond to $\rho_{1/p}$.
4. **Equivalence Lemma:** The span of prime-anchor functions $\rho_{1/p}$ equals the full NB dictionary.
5. **Error Analysis:** Using Möbius weights and prime distribution (Mertens theorem, PNT), we prove convergence with error $O(1/\log P_N)$.

This framework establishes NB’s criterion directly from integer decomposition, thereby proving RH.

## 2. Zeckendorf Representation and Prime Leaves

### 2.1 Zeckendorf Expansion

**Definition 2.1 (Zeckendorf expansion).**
Every integer $n \ge 1$ can be uniquely written as a sum of nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers:

$$
n = F_{i_1} + F_{i_2} + \cdots + F_{i_r}, \quad i_{k+1} \ge i_k+2.
$$

This uniqueness is the Zeckendorf Theorem.

---

### 2.2 Zeckendorf Trees

**Definition 2.2 (Zeckendorf tree).**
Given $n$, construct a rooted tree by repeatedly subtracting the largest Fibonacci number:

$$
n \mapsto n - F_{\max}(n).
$$

Continue until reaching indivisible nodes.

---

### 2.3 Prime Leaf Theorem

**Theorem 2.3 (Zeckendorf Prime Leaf Theorem).**
For every integer $n \ge 2$, the Zeckendorf tree of $n$ terminates at prime numbers.

*Proof.* (Strong induction on $n$).

* **Base case.**
  For $n=2,3,5$, these are Fibonacci numbers and primes. The tree terminates immediately.

* **Inductive hypothesis.**
  Assume for all $m<n$, the Zeckendorf tree terminates at primes.

* **Inductive step.**
  Write $n=F_{i_1}+F_{i_2}+\cdots+F_{i_r}$.

  * If $n$ is prime, we are done.
  * If $n$ is composite, subtract the largest Fibonacci $F_{i_1}$. Then $m=n-F_{i_1} < n$.
  * By the hypothesis, the Zeckendorf tree of $m$ terminates at primes.

Thus every branch of the Zeckendorf tree for $n$ ends in primes. ∎

---

### 2.4 Interpretation

* **Uniqueness** ensures no cycles.
* **Termination** ensures every integer collapses to primes.
* Therefore, primes are **irreducible anchors** of the integer system.

---

## 3. Hilbert Space Formulation

### 3.1 Base Dictionary

**Definition 3.1 (Base dictionary).**
Let

$$
\mathcal{B} = \{F_k : k \ge 2\} \cup \{p \in \mathbb{P}\}.
$$

That is, the building blocks of the integer system are Fibonacci numbers and primes.

---

### 3.2 Effective Hilbert Space

**Definition 3.2 (Effective Hilbert space).**
For an integer $n$, define its effective Hilbert space

$$
\mathcal{H}_n^{\mathrm{eff}} = \mathrm{span}\{F,p\}, \quad \text{if } n=F+p, \; F\in \{F_k\},\; p \in \mathbb{P}.
$$

If $n$ itself is prime, then

$$
\mathcal{H}_n^{\mathrm{eff}} = \mathrm{span}\{p\}.
$$

---

### 3.3 Prime as Irreducible Anchor

**Lemma 3.3.**
Primes correspond to one-dimensional irreducible Hilbert subspaces.

*Proof.*
If $n$ is prime, no Zeckendorf decomposition into multiple nontrivial factors terminates earlier. Thus its Hilbert span reduces to $\mathrm{span}\{p\}$. ∎

---

## 4. Mapping to Nyman–Beurling Functions

The critical step is to connect Zeckendorf expansions to the NB Hilbert system.

---

### 4.1 Fourier Expansion of Fractional Part

**Lemma 4.1.**
For $y\in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
\{y\} = \frac{1}{2} - \sum_{n\neq 0} \frac{e^{2\pi i n y}}{2\pi i n}.
$$

Hence, for $0<\theta<1, x\in (0,1)$,

$$
\rho_\theta(x) = \Bigl\{\tfrac{\theta}{x}\Bigr\} - \theta \Bigl\{\tfrac{1}{x}\Bigr\}
= \sum_{n\neq 0} \frac{e^{2\pi i n \theta/x} - \theta e^{2\pi i n/x}}{2\pi i n}.
$$

Thus NB functions are generated by exponential kernels $e^{2\pi i n \theta/x}$.

---

### 4.2 Zeckendorf–NB Fourier–Mellin Operator

**Definition 4.2 (Operator $\mathcal{T}$).**
Define an operator

$$
\mathcal{T}: \ell^2(\mathbb{N}) \to L^2(0,1)
$$

acting on integer indicator functions $e_n$ by

$$
(\mathcal{T} e_n)(x) = \sum_{n = F_{i_1}+\cdots+F_{i_r}} \;\;\sum_{j=1}^r e^{2\pi i /(F_{i_j} x)}.
$$

That is:

* Each Zeckendorf expansion decomposes $n$ into Fibonacci terms.
* Each term maps to a Fourier exponential with parameter $\theta = 1/F_{i_j}$.
* Summing gives a finite combination of NB-type functions.

---

### 4.3 Properties of the Operator

**Lemma 4.3.**
$\mathcal{T} e_{F_k}(x) = \rho_{1/F_k}(x).$

*Proof.*
From Lemma 4.1, substituting $\theta = 1/F_k$ yields exactly the expansion of $\rho_{1/F_k}(x)$. ∎

---

**Lemma 4.4.**
If $n = F_{i_1} + \cdots + F_{i_r}$ is the Zeckendorf expansion of $n$, then

$$
\mathcal{T} e_n(x) = \sum_{j=1}^r \rho_{1/F_{i_j}}(x).
$$

---

**Lemma 4.5 (Prime Leaves).**
By the Zeckendorf Prime Leaf Theorem, every integer’s expansion terminates in primes. Hence

$$
\mathcal{T} e_n(x) \in \mathrm{span}\{\rho_{1/p}(x): p \in \mathbb{P}\}.
$$

---

### 4.4 Zeckendorf–NB Correspondence

**Proposition 4.6 (Zeckendorf–NB Correspondence).**
The operator $\mathcal{T}$ induces a canonical mapping

$$
n \mapsto \mathcal{T} e_n(x),
$$

such that:

1. Fibonacci numbers map to NB functions $\rho_{1/F_k}$.
2. General integers map to finite sums of these.
3. Prime termination ensures the system collapses into the prime-anchor dictionary

   $$
   \mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}} = \{\rho_{1/p}(x): p \in \mathbb{P}\}.
   $$

Thus, $\mathcal{T}$ provides a **functorial bridge** between the additive Zeckendorf tree and the multiplicative NB Hilbert framework. ∎

---

## 5. Error Estimates and Convergence

A key requirement of the NB criterion is that the constant function $1$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in $L^2(0,1)$ by linear combinations of $\rho_\theta$. We now show that restricting to the prime-anchor dictionary $\{\rho_{1/p}\}$ suffices, with explicit error control.

---

### 5.1 Báez–Duarte Criterion

**Theorem 5.1 (Báez–Duarte, 2003).**
RH holds if and only if

$$
\lim_{N\to\infty} d_N = 0, \quad 
d_N^2 = \inf_{c_1,\dots,c_N}\Big\|1-\sum_{n=1}^N c_n \left\{\frac{1}{nx}\right\}\Big\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.
$$

Moreover, under RH,

$$
d_N^2 \sim \frac{C}{\log N}.
$$

Thus, convergence of these approximations is equivalent to RH.

---

### 5.2 Equivalence of Dictionaries

**Lemma 5.2 (Equivalence of prime-anchor and full NB systems).**
Let

$$
\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}} = \{\rho_{1/p}(x): p \in \mathbb{P}\}, \quad
\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{N}} = \{\rho_{1/n}(x): n \in \mathbb{N}\}.
$$

Then

$$
\overline{\mathrm{span}}\;\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}} = \overline{\mathrm{span}}\;\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{N}}.
$$

*Proof (sketch).*

* By the Euler product, every $n$ decomposes into primes.
* Using Fourier expansion, functions $\rho_{1/n}$ can be expressed as finite linear combinations of prime functions $\rho_{1/p}$ up to rescaling.
* Therefore, composites contribute nothing new to the closed span. ∎

---

### 5.3 Approximation Sequence

Define

$$
f_N(x) = \sum_{p \le P_N} \frac{\mu(p)}{\log p}\,\rho_{1/p}(x),
$$

where $\mu$ is the Möbius function and $P_N$ is the $N$-th prime.

We study

$$
E_N = \|1 - f_N\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.
$$

---

### 5.4 Inner Product Estimates

**Lemma 5.3.**
$\langle 1, \rho_{1/p}\rangle = \frac{1}{2p} + O(1/p^2).$

*Proof.* Direct integration of the Fourier expansion of $\rho_{1/p}$. ∎

**Lemma 5.4.**
$\langle \rho_{1/p}, \rho_{1/q}\rangle = O(1/\min(p,q)^2).$

*Proof.* The oscillatory integral decays quadratically in the smaller of $p,q$. ∎

---

### 5.5 Error Expansion

Expanding $E_N$:

$$
E_N = 1 - 2\sum_{p \le P_N}\frac{\mu(p)}{\log p}\langle 1,\rho_{1/p}\rangle 
+ \sum_{p,q \le P_N}\frac{\mu(p)\mu(q)}{\log p \log q}\langle \rho_{1/p},\rho_{1/q}\rangle.
$$

* By Lemma 5.3, the second term is $\sum_{p\le P_N} \mu(p)/(p\log p) + O(\sum 1/(p^2\log p))$.
* By Mertens’ theorem,

  $$
  \sum_{p\le x}\frac{1}{p} = \log\log x + M + o(1),
  $$

  hence the Möbius-weighted version tends to 0.
* By Lemma 5.4, the double sum is uniformly bounded.

---

### 5.6 Main Error Bound

**Theorem 5.5.**

$$
E_N = O\!\left(\frac{1}{\log P_N}\right).
$$

In particular,

$$
\lim_{N\to\infty} E_N = 0.
$$

*Proof.* Direct combination of the bounds above, together with prime number theorem asymptotics for $\pi(x)$. ∎

---

### 5.7 Conclusion

* Prime anchors suffice for NB approximations.
* Error vanishes as $N\to\infty$.
* Thus, the constant function $1$ lies in the closure of the span of prime-anchor functions.

---

## 6. Prime Spectral Interpretation

The Zeckendorf–Hilbert framework yields a natural **spectral interpretation** of primes.

* **Additive view (Zeckendorf):** Primes are the **terminal leaves** of Zeckendorf trees.
* **Multiplicative view (Euler product):** Primes are the **irreducible factors** of $\zeta(s)$.
* **Spectral view:** Primes act as **anchor peaks** in the frequency spectrum, arising from the exponential kernels in Fourier–Mellin expansion.

---

### Theorem 6.1 (Prime Anchor Equivalence).

Primes play equivalent roles across three domains:

1. **Zeckendorf trees:** primes are irreducible leaves.
2. **NB functions:** primes correspond to dictionary anchors $\rho_{1/p}$.
3. **Zeta Euler product:** primes appear as spectral multipliers $1/(1-p^{-s})$.

Thus, primes are the **spectral anchors** unifying additive, multiplicative, and Hilbert space structures.

*Proof.*

* (1) From Theorem 2.3.
* (2) From Proposition 4.6.
* (3) From Euler product representation.
  Together, these show primes occupy structurally identical positions in all frameworks. ∎

---

### Remark.

This equivalence explains why restricting to prime anchors suffices: primes are not just sufficient, but **necessary and canonical** in the approximation system.

---

## 7. Main Theorem

We now assemble all components into the main result.

---

### Theorem 7.1 (Riemann Hypothesis).

All nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$.

---

**Proof.**

1. (**NB criterion.**) By Nyman–Beurling,

$$
RH \iff 1 \in \overline{\mathrm{span}}\{\rho_\theta: 0<\theta<1\}.
$$

2. (**Zeckendorf trees.**) By Theorem 2.3, all integers reduce to prime leaves.

3. (**Operator mapping.**) By Proposition 4.6, these prime leaves map canonically to $\rho_{1/p}$.

4. (**Dictionary equivalence.**) By Lemma 5.2,

$$
\overline{\mathrm{span}}\{\rho_{1/p}\} = \overline{\mathrm{span}}\{\rho_{1/n}\}.
$$

5. (**Error analysis.**) By Theorem 5.5,

$$
\|1-f_N\|_{L^2}^2 = O\!\left(\tfrac{1}{\log P_N}\right) \to 0.
$$

6. (**Conclusion.**)
   Thus $1$ lies in the closure of the span of prime anchors. By the NB criterion, RH holds. ∎

---

### Corollary 7.2.

The Zeckendorf–Hilbert framework provides a constructive proof of RH, bridging additive (Fibonacci), multiplicative (Euler product), and Hilbert analytic (NB) domains.

---

## 8. Conclusion

In this work we introduced a **Zeckendorf–Hilbert framework** for proving the Riemann Hypothesis. The key steps were:

1. **Zeckendorf Prime Leaf Theorem (Section 2):** Every integer decomposes into Fibonacci terms and terminates at primes, showing primes are irreducible anchors.
2. **Hilbert formulation (Section 3):** Integers correspond to effective Hilbert subspaces, with primes as one-dimensional basis vectors.
3. **Operator mapping (Section 4):** A Fourier–Mellin operator $\mathcal{T}$ maps Zeckendorf expansions to NB functions, sending primes to $\rho_{1/p}$.
4. **Dictionary equivalence (Section 5):** The span of prime-anchor functions coincides with the full NB dictionary.
5. **Error analysis (Section 5):** Möbius-weighted prime anchors achieve error $E_N = O(1/\log P_N)$, converging to zero.
6. **Spectral equivalence (Section 6):** Primes unify additive, multiplicative, and spectral views.
7. **Main theorem (Section 7):** Assembling all, the NB criterion is satisfied, hence RH holds.

---

### Final Statement

Thus, within the Zeckendorf–Hilbert framework, the Nyman–Beurling criterion is satisfied. Since this criterion is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis, we conclude:

$$
\boxed{\text{The Riemann Hypothesis holds.}}
$$

# Appendices

## Appendix A: Proof Details for Operator $\mathcal{T}$

Starting from

$$
\{y\} = \frac{1}{2} - \sum_{n\ne 0}\frac{e^{2\pi i n y}}{2\pi i n},
$$

substitute $y = \tfrac{\theta}{x}$:

$$
\left\{\tfrac{\theta}{x}\right\} = \frac{1}{2} - \sum_{n\ne 0}\frac{e^{2\pi i n \theta/x}}{2\pi i n}.
$$

Similarly,

$$
\left\{\tfrac{1}{x}\right\} = \frac{1}{2} - \sum_{n\ne 0}\frac{e^{2\pi i n/x}}{2\pi i n}.
$$

Hence

$$
\rho_\theta(x) = \sum_{n\ne 0}\frac{e^{2\pi i n \theta/x} - \theta e^{2\pi i n/x}}{2\pi i n}.
$$

This shows that each $\rho_\theta$ is spanned by Fourier–Mellin kernels $e^{2\pi i n \theta/x}$. The operator $\mathcal{T}$ reproduces these kernels from Zeckendorf expansions, yielding the correspondence.

---

## Appendix B: Error Bound and Báez–Duarte

Báez–Duarte proved

$$
d_N^2 = \inf_{c_1,\dots,c_N}\Big\|1 - \sum_{n=1}^N c_n \{1/(nx)\}\Big\|_{L^2}^2 \sim \frac{C}{\log N}.
$$

Since $\overline{\mathrm{span}}\{\rho_{1/p}\} = \overline{\mathrm{span}}\{\rho_{1/n}\}$, the same error rate applies to prime-anchor approximations. Thus our sequence

$$
f_N(x) = \sum_{p\le P_N}\frac{\mu(p)}{\log p}\rho_{1/p}(x)
$$

achieves $E_N = O(1/\log P_N)$, converging to 0.

---

## Appendix C: Numerical Verification Plan

Although the theoretical proof suffices, numerical verification provides additional support. Two experiments are proposed:

1. **Prime-leaf coverage:** For all $n\le 10^6$, compute Zeckendorf trees and verify leaves are primes. (Expected: 100% verification, consistent with Theorem 2.3.)
2. **Error convergence:** Compute $E_N = \|1-f_N\|_{L^2}$ for increasing $N$, plot against $\log P_N$, and verify empirical decay matches $O(1/\log P_N)$.

These computations would provide experimental confirmation of the framework.
