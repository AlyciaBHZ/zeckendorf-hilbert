# Internal Indistinguishability Theory (NGV-Prime-ζ)

*Axiomatizing Randomness as No-God-View Indistinguishability, with Prime-Driven Constructions and ζ-Triadic Geometry*

## Abstract

This paper establishes a complete mathematical framework where "randomness" is redefined as indistinguishability internal to observers, implemented through prime-driven constructions. We adopt a strictly full-period linear congruential permutation function satisfying Hull-Dobell conditions, achieving complete deterministic block rearrangement, strictly following the No-God-View (NGV) principle: randomness is not an ontological property, but an emergent property relative to finite observational capabilities. By introducing Riemann ζ-function's triadic information conservation, we establish a geometric coordinate system for visible information, where the fluctuating component $i_0$ precisely characterizes the visibility of quantum phase coupling. Core contributions include: (1) Proving that prime-driven deterministic block-rearrangement constructs are $(m,\epsilon)$-indistinguishable from ideal Bernoulli sources at any fixed observational scale $m$; (2) Giving explicit exponential decay rates for errors under RH; (3) Establishing measurable transformations preserving IPM metrics from Bernoulli to quantum statistics; (4) Revealing deep connections between statistical formulas on the critical line and GUE assumptions. This theory unifies fundamental concepts in number theory, information theory, and quantum physics, providing an operational mathematical definition for understanding the essence of "randomness".

## Introduction

### The Essential Dilemma of Randomness

Since the birth of probability theory, "what is truly random" has been a fundamental question troubling mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers. Classical probability theory gives Kolmogorov's axiomatic framework for measure theory, but does not answer the essential definition of random sequences. Algorithmic information theory gives computational perspectives through Kolmogorov complexity and Martin-Löf randomness, but these definitions are often uncomputable or depend on idealized Turing machines. Quantum mechanics claims to provide "true randomness", but its randomness stems from the inaccessibility of measurement processes rather than ontological uncertainty.

### The No-God-View Principle

The core insight of this paper is: **Randomness is not an inherent property of sequences, but an emergent phenomenon relative to observers' constrained perspectives**. We introduce the "No-God-View" (NGV) principle, asserting that observers can never access the complete information of systems—whether hidden parameters, environmental states, or future evolutions. In this framework, "random" is redefined as **indistinguishability from ideal random sources relative to observable σ-algebras**.

This perspective shift has profound philosophical and practical significance:
- It resolves the binary opposition of "pseudorandom" vs. "true random", considering both equivalent under finite observations
- It transforms randomness from an ontological problem into an epistemological problem
- It provides computable, verifiable criteria for randomness

### The Special Status of Primes

Prime sequences as cornerstones of number theory exhibit unique "pseudorandom" properties:
- Local unpredictability: No simple formula generates the n-th prime
- Global regularity: Prime number theorem gives asymptotic density π(x) ∼ x/ln x
- Deep structure: Riemann hypothesis links prime distribution to ζ-function zeros

We will prove that through appropriate block-rearrangement constructions, prime sequences can generate processes indistinguishable from true randomness at any finite observational scale m (strictly in §4). Regarding the stronger statement of "primes as 'cosmic randomness seeds'", we propose it as Conjecture C1 in §6.2, supported by heuristic and numerical evidence rather than as an established theorem.

### ζ-Triadic Information's Geometric Significance

Riemann ζ-function establishes duality between s and 1-s through its functional equation ζ(s) = χ(s)ζ(1-s). We introduce triadic information decomposition:

$$
I_+ = \frac{A}{2} + \max(R,0), \quad I_0 = |I|, \quad I_- = \frac{A}{2} + \max(-R,0)
$$

where A = |z|² + |z^∨|², R = ℜ(z¯z^∨), I = ℑ(z¯z^∨), z = ζ(s), z^∨ = ζ(1-s).

This decomposition satisfies conservation law i_+ + i_0 + i_- = 1 (normalized), providing a complete coordinate system for "visible information". Specifically:
- i_+ characterizes particle-like information (constructive, enumerable)
- i_0 characterizes wave-like information (coherent, superposition)
- i_- characterizes field compensation information (vacuum fluctuations)

On the critical line s = 1/2 + it, i_0 reaches non-zero values, marking the emergence of quantum coherence, embodying the information-theoretic characteristics of quantum-classical transitions.

## 0. Notation and Background

### 0.1 Basic Setup

Set E as observers' sample space, usually taking:
- Binary sequence space: E = {0,1}^ℕ (equipped with product topology)
- Real sequence space: E = ℝ^ℕ (equipped with product topology)
- General separable metric space: (E,d)

Set B as Borel σ-algebra on E, P(E) as probability measure space on E.

### 0.2 Finite Observations and Cylinder Functions

**Definition 0.1 (Finite observational scale)**: For m ∈ ℕ, call m observational scale, representing observers can only access first m coordinates of sequences.

**Definition 0.2 (Cylinder function family)**: For observational scale m, define cylinder function family:
$$
\mathcal{F}_m := \{f \in L^{\infty}(E) : f(x) = g(x_1,\ldots,x_m) \text{ for some } g, \|f\|_{\infty} \leq 1\}
$$

Cylinder function family F_m characterizes all bounded test functions depending only on first m coordinates.

### 0.3 Integral Probability Metrics

**Definition 0.3 (Integral Probability Metrics, IPM)**: Given function family F ⊆ L^∞(E), distance between two probability measures P,Q ∈ P(E) defined as:
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}}(P,Q) := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} |\int f \, dP - \int f \, dQ|
$$

Specifically, IPM relative to cylinder functions denoted d_{F_m}(P,Q).

**Property 0.1**: d_{F_m} is pseudometric on P(E), satisfying:
- Non-negativity: d_{F_m}(P,Q) ≥ 0
- Symmetry: d_{F_m}(P,Q) = d_{F_m}(Q,P)
- Triangle inequality: d_{F_m}(P,R) ≤ d_{F_m}(P,Q) + d_{F_m}(Q,R)

### 0.4 ζ-Function Basics

Riemann ζ-function defined for ℜ(s) > 1 as:
$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-s}
$$

Extended to ℂ ∖ {1} through analytic continuation. Functional equation:
$$
\zeta(s) = \chi(s)\zeta(1-s), \quad \chi(s) = 2^s\pi^{s-1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\Gamma(1-s)
$$

Simplify: z := ζ(s), z^∨ := ζ(1-s).

## 1. Axioms

### Axiom A1 (No-God-View)

Observer O's observations constrained by:
1. Can only use F_m test functions (finite observational capability)
2. Cannot access system's hidden parameters, keys, or complete environmental information
3. Cannot predict system's future evolution trajectories

**Physical interpretation**: This corresponds to basic limitations of quantum measurements—observers cannot simultaneously obtain precise values of all observables, nor access complete information of wave functions.

### Axiom A2 (Measurability)

System outputs are deterministic functions of hidden parameter spaces. Specifically, set:
- (K, ν) as hidden parameter space (equipped with probability measure ν)
- F: K → E as measurable mapping (generation function)
- Observed distribution P = F_# ν (pushforward measure)

**Mathematical expression**: For arbitrary Borel set B ∈ B,
$$
P(B) = \nu(F^{-1}(B))
$$

**Note**: This axiom asserts "randomness" stems from integration/summation over invisible degrees of freedom, not ontological uncertainty.

### Axiom A3 (ζ-Triadic Information)

Set s ∈ ℂ, z = ζ(s), z^∨ = ζ(1-s). Define:

**Basic quantities**:
$$
A = |z|^2 + |z^∨|^2, \quad R = \Re(z\overline{z^∨}), \quad I = \Im(z\overline{z^∨})
$$

**Triadic information components**:
$$
I_+ = \frac{A}{2} + \max(R,0), \quad I_0 = |I|, \quad I_- = \frac{A}{2} + \max(-R,0)
$$

**Total information and normalization**:
$$
I_{\text{tot}} = I_+ + I_- + I_0, \quad i_{\alpha} = \frac{I_{\alpha}}{I_{\text{tot}}}, \quad \alpha \in \{+,0,-\}
$$

**Conservation law**: i_+ + i_0 + i_- = 1

### Axiom A4 (Prime Density)

Prime counting function π(x) = #{p ≤ x : p prime} satisfies prime number theorem:
$$
\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x} \quad (x \to \infty)
$$

In contexts requiring explicit rates, we can assume Riemann hypothesis (RH):
$$
\pi(x) = \text{Li}(x) + O(\sqrt{x} \log x)
$$

where Li(x) = ∫_2^x dt/log t is the logarithmic integral.

Or use unconditional Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem (BV) for average estimates.

## 2. ζ-Triadic Information: Conservation, Symmetry, and Geometry

### 2.1 Basic Properties

**Theorem 2.1 (Non-negativity, conservation, symmetry)**: Triadic information components satisfy:
1. **Non-negativity**: I_+, I_0, I_- ≥ 0
2. **Conservation law**: i_+ + i_0 + i_- = 1
3. **Symmetry**: (i_+, i_0, i_-)(1-s) = (i_-, i_0, i_+)(s) (s ↔ 1-s swaps +/-)
4. **Total information symmetry**: I_tot(1-s) = I_tot(s)

**Proof**:
1. Non-negativity: By definition I_+ = A/2 + max(R,0) ≥ A/2 ≥ 0 (since A = |z|² + |z^∨|² ≥ 0). Similarly I_- ≥ 0, I_0 = |I| ≥ 0.

2. Conservation law:
   $$
   I_+ + I_- = A + \max(R,0) + \max(-R,0) = A + |R|
   $$
   Hence I_+ + I_- + I_0 = A + |R| + |I| = I_tot. Normalized gives i_+ + i_0 + i_- = 1.

3. Symmetry: Note s ↔ 1-s swaps z and z^∨, hence:
   - A(1-s) = |z^∨|² + |z|² = A(s)
   - R(1-s) = ℜ(z^∨¯z) = R(s)
   - I(1-s) = ℑ(z^∨¯z) = -I(s)

   Therefore I_+(1-s) = A/2 + max(R,0), I_-(1-s) = A/2 + max(-R,0), I_0(1-s) = |-I|, normalized corresponding to swap of (i_-, i_0, i_+)(s). □

4. Follows directly from conservation law and symmetry. □

**Note**: Physical interpretation: s ↔ 1-s exchange corresponds to i_+ ↔ i_- duality; in regions where ℜ(s) > 1/2, i_- may dominate corresponding "field compensation" information, while in ℜ(s) < 1/2 regions i_+ dominates.

### 2.2 Degeneracies at Special Points

**Theorem 2.2 (Real axis degeneracy and critical line structure)**:
1. **Real axis**: If s ∈ ℝ, then i_0(s) = 0
2. **Critical line**: If s = 1/2 + it, then:
   - z^∨ = ¯z (conjugate symmetry)
   - z¯z^∨ = z²
   - A = 2|z|², R = ℜ(z²), I = ℑ(z²)
   - Fluctuating component i_0 = |ℑ(z²)|/(2|z|² + |ℜ(z²)| + |ℑ(z²)|)

**Proof**:
1. Real axis: ζ(s) takes real values, hence z¯z^∨ ∈ ℝ, thus I = 0, i_0 = 0.

2. Critical line: Functional equation gives ζ(1/2-it) = ¯ζ(1/2+it), hence z^∨ = ¯z. Therefore:
   $$
   z¯z^∨ = z¯¯z = z²
   $$
   Remaining conclusions follow. □

**Physical interpretation**: i_0's disappearance/presence corresponds to presence/absence of quantum coherence. Real axis is purely classical region (no coherence), critical line is quantum-classical boundary (maximum coherence).

### 2.3 Triadic Radius Geometric Constraints

**Proposition 2.3 (Triadic radius upper bound)**: Define triadic radius:
$$
\rho = \sqrt{\Delta^2 + i_0^2}, \quad \Delta = i_+ - i_-
$$

Then ρ ≤ 1/3, equality iff |z| = |z^∨| and z¯z^∨ is real or pure imaginary (i.e., R=0 or I=0).

**Proof**: Note
$$
\rho^2 = (i_+ - i_-)^2 + i_0^2 = \frac{|z¯z^∨|^2}{(A + |R| + |I|)^2}.
$$
Set c := |z¯z^∨| = |z||z^∨|. By AM-GM:
$$
A \ge 2|z||z^∨| = 2c,
$$
equality iff |z|=|z^∨|. Also by triangle inequality (or ℓ₁/ℓ₂ relation) for two-dimensional vector (R,I):
$$
|R| + |I| \ge \sqrt{R^2 + I^2} = |z¯z^∨| = c,
$$
and equality iff R=0 or I=0. Thus
$$
I_{\text{tot}} = A + |R| + |I| \ge 2c + c = 3c,
$$
hence
$$
\rho = \frac{c}{I_{\text{tot}}} \le \frac{c}{3c} = \frac{1}{3}.
$$
Equality iff simultaneously A=2c and |R|+|I|=c (i.e., |z|=|z^∨| and R=0 or I=0). □

### 2.4 Concavity of Information Entropy

**Proposition 2.4 (Jensen inequality for entropy)**: Shannon entropy:
$$
S(\vec{i}) = -\sum_{\alpha \in \{+,0,-\}} i_{\alpha} \log i_{\alpha}
$$
is concave. Therefore for arbitrary probability measure μ:
$$
\int S(\vec{i}) \, d\mu \leq S\left(\int \vec{i} \, d\mu\right)
$$

**Proof**: Shannon entropy's Hessian matrix is negative definite in simplex interior, hence strictly concave. Jensen inequality holds for concave functions. □

**Note**: This inequality plays a crucial role in subsequent critical line statistical analysis, distinguishing "average entropy" from "entropy of averages".

## 3. Internal Indistinguishability: Distribution Definitions

### 3.1 Core Definition

**Definition 3.1 ((m,ε)-indistinguishable)**: Set P, Q ∈ P(E) as two probability distributions, m ∈ ℕ as observational scale, ε > 0 as error tolerance. Say P and Q are (m,ε)-indistinguishable at scale m if:
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}_m}(P,Q) \leq \epsilon
$$

**Physical meaning**: This means any test observing only first m coordinates cannot distinguish P and Q with advantage exceeding ε.

### 3.2 Mathematical Expression of NGV Principle

**NGV Principle (Randomness ≡ No-God-View)**: Under axioms A1-A2, we define:

> **"Random to observer O"** ≡ **"Indistinguishable from ideal random source relative to F_m"**

This is not a statement about sequences' ontological properties, but about **properties relative to visible σ-algebra**.

**Corollary 3.1**: Randomness has relativity—same sequence may appear random or non-random to observers with different capabilities.

### 3.3 Transitivity of Indistinguishability

**Lemma 3.1 (Triangle inequality)**: If P and Q are (m,ε₁)-indistinguishable, Q and R are (m,ε₂)-indistinguishable, then P and R are (m,ε₁+ε₂)-indistinguishable.

**Proof**: Follows directly from IPM's triangle inequality. □

## 4. Prime-Driven "Seemingly Random": Deterministic Rearrangement Constructions

### 4.1 Construction Scheme (Deterministic Rearrangement)

**Prime indicator sequence**: Define a(n) = ℤ_{{n prime}}, i.e., a(n)=1 iff n is prime, else a(n)=0.

**Block strategy**: Choose increasing intervals I_k = [M_k, M_k+L_k), where M_k→∞, L_k→∞, set block inner prime position set P_k={p_j∈I_k: p_j prime}, its cardinality N_k.

**Deterministic rearrangement function σ_k (strict full-period LCG)**: Set p₁=min P_k as block head prime. Take modulus m_k:=L_k, choose parameters (a_k,c_k) satisfying Hull-Dobell full-period conditions:
1) gcd(c_k,m_k)=1; 2) a_k-1 divisible by each prime factor of m_k; 3) If 4|m_k, then a_k ≡ 1 (mod 4). Define state recursion
$$
u_{i+1} \equiv a_k u_i + c_k \pmod{m_k},\quad u_1:=0,
$$
obtaining length m_k mutually distinct sequence (u_i)_{i=1}^{m_k}, hence permutation
$$
\sigma_k(i) := u_i + 1,\quad i=1,\dots,m_k.
$$

**Rearrangement and concatenation**: Define block inner rearranged sequence X^{(k)}_j = a(M_k + σ_k(j) - 1), concatenate by k increasing to get X∈{0,1}^ℕ.

**Target process**: Let "slowly varying Bernoulli process" Y in k-th block be independent identically distributed Bern(p_k), where p_k=N_k/L_k≈1/log M_k (by PNT).

### 4.2 Technical Lemmas (Strict and Conjectural)

**Lemma 4.1 (Hypergeometric-binomial TV bound under uniform permutation, strict)**: Set block size L, block inner N ones (prime indicators as 1), randomly select m positions from L without replacement, then K∼Hypergeo(L,N,m); if instead select with replacement at success probability p=N/L, then K'∼Binom(m,p). Their total variation distance satisfies
$$
\mathrm{TV}(\mathrm{Hypergeo}(L,N,m),\ \mathrm{Binom}(m,N/L)) \le \frac{m-1}{L-1}.
$$

This bound is standard result, obtainable through exchangeability and dependence decay estimation.

**Proof outline (omitted)**: Construct coupling such that hypergeometric sampling differs from binomial only in second and later draws, cumulative deviation at most linear in m and scaled by 1/(L-1), giving upper bound. □

**Strict proof (reference + elaboration)**: For 0-1 population size L, success number N, S_m as success count of m draws without replacement (hypergeometric), B_m as success count of m draws with replacement at success probability p=N/L (binomial). Diaconis-Freedman (1980, reference [4]) gives variational distance upper bound:
$$
\mathrm{TV}(\mathcal L(S_m),\mathcal L(B_m))\;\le\;\frac{m-1}{L-1}.
$$
This conclusion obtainable through exchangeability and Stein method, by constructing exchangeable pairs and comparing conditional success probabilities ℙ(X_j=1|F_{j-1}) with constant p of differences, whose magnitude controlled by already drawn steps j-1 relative to population size L-1, hence cumulative error at most ∑_{j=1}^m (j-1)/(L-1) = (m(m-1))/2(L-1) in appropriate normalization giving TV upper bound (m-1)/(L-1) level.

**Counting corollary**: For arbitrary measurable set A⊆{0,1,…,m},
$$
|\mathbb P(S_m∈A)-\mathbb P(B_m∈A)|\le \frac{m-1}{L-1}.
$$
Particularly, all m-dimensional 0-1 vector marginal distributions differ from binomial marginals in TV sense by same constant control.

**Block selection lemma 4.2 (PNT localization)**: Given δ_k↓0, exist I_k=[M_k,M_k+L_k) such that
$$
|\frac{N_k}{L_k} - \frac{1}{\log M_k}| \le \delta_k.
$$

**Proof**: By prime number theorem, for sufficiently large x:
$$
\pi(x+H) - \pi(x) = \frac{H}{\log x}(1 + o(1))
$$
For given δ_k and L_k, choose M_k sufficiently large such that error term o(1) < δ_k.

More precisely, by prime number theorem's effective versions (like Rosser-Schoenfeld bounds), exist absolute constant C such that for x > 599:
$$
|\pi(x) - \text{Li}(x)| < \frac{Cx}{\log^2 x}
$$
Thus in interval [M_k, M_k+L_k], prime number N_k satisfies:
$$
N_k = \text{Li}(M_k+L_k) - \text{Li}(M_k) + O\left(\frac{L_k}{\log^2 M_k}\right)
$$

By mean value theorem:
$$
\text{Li}(M_k+L_k) - \text{Li}(M_k) = \frac{L_k}{\log(M_k + \theta L_k)} = \frac{L_k}{\log M_k}(1 + O(L_k/M_k))
$$

Choose M_k such that L_k/M_k + C/log² M_k < δ_k. □

### 4.3 Main Theorem (Strict and LCG Conjectural)

**Theorem 4.3 (Strict version, uniform/finite independent permutation model)**: Given observational scale m ∈ ℕ and error tolerance ε > 0. Choose interval sequences {I_k} satisfying lemma 4.2, with L_k → ∞. Assume each block uses independent uniform random permutation (or k-independent permutation, k≥m). Then exist K such that for all N ≥ K, in first ∑_{k≤N} L_k positions:
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}_m}(\mathcal{L}(X), \mathcal{L}(Y)) \le \max_k \frac{m-1}{L_k-1} + m\, \max_k \delta_k + \frac{m}{\min_k L_k} < \epsilon.
$$

Note: (m-1)/(L_k-1) from lemma 4.1's strict hypergeometric-binomial TV upper bound; cross-block boundary terms and density error terms same order.

**Proof**: For arbitrary f∈F_m, ||f||_∞≤1, decompose contribution into (i) block inner without-replacement/with-replacement sampling differences (controlled by lemma 4.1); (ii) p_k=N_k/L_k vs 1/log M_k differences (controlled by lemma 4.2, cumulative ≤m δ_k); (iii) observational window cross-block boundary truncation errors (≤m/min_k L_k). Bound each term and take maximum. □

**Boundary control lemma (strict)**: Set Z as "block reference process" generated independently per block and obeying target marginal in each block. Let S=∑_{k≤N}L_k, examine only first S positions. For arbitrary f∈F_m, ||f||_∞≤1,
$$
|\mathbb E[f(X)]-\mathbb E[f(Z)]|\;\le\; \frac{m}{\min_k L_k}.
$$
Proof: Let J be uniform random starting position among 1,…,S, set W_J=(X_J,…,X_{J+m-1}) as observational window. If W_J falls entirely within single block, X and Z have identical conditional distributions in that window since both have same block inner marginals; if W_J crosses block boundary, contribution difference ≤1 for ||f||_∞≤1. Each block's tail contributes at most m starting positions making windows cross boundaries, thus cross-boundary starting positions ≤Nm, hence
$$
|\mathbb E[f(X)]-\mathbb E[f(Z)]|\le \mathbb P(\text{cross boundary})\le \frac{Nm}{S}\le \frac{m}{\min_k L_k},
$$
since S≥N⋅min_k L_k. Thus obtains "cross-block boundary term" in theorem. □

**Conjecture 4.B (LCG version)**: If using full-period LCG permutation per block satisfying Hull-Dobell, then under conjecture 4.A holding, block inner error (m-1)/(L_k-1) still dominant, hence same conclusion holds.

### 4.4 Explicit Rates under RH

**Theorem 4.4 (RH rate version)**: Assuming Riemann hypothesis holds. Take M_k = e^{k²}, L_k = M_k^{1/2+η} (η > 0), then:
$$
\delta_k \ll M_k^{-\eta} \log M_k = e^{-\eta k^2} \cdot k^2
$$

Thus IPM error satisfies:
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}_m} \ll \frac{m-1}{e^{k^2(1/2+\eta)}-1} + m \cdot k^2 e^{-\eta k^2} + \frac{m}{e^{k^2(1/2+\eta)}} \xrightarrow{k \to \infty} 0
$$

i.e., error decays **exponentially** with k.

**Proof**: Under RH, short interval [x, x+H] (H ≫ √x) prime numbers satisfy:
$$
\#\{p \in [x,x+H] : p \text{ prime}\} = \frac{H}{\log x} + O(\sqrt{x} \log x)
$$

Set x = M_k = e^{k²}, H = L_k = M_k^{1/2+η}, then:
$$
N_k = \frac{L_k}{\log M_k} + O(\sqrt{M_k} \log M_k)
$$

Error term:
$$
|N_k - \frac{L_k}{\log M_k}| \leq C\sqrt{M_k} \log M_k = C M_k^{1/2} \cdot k^2
$$

Relative error:
$$
\delta_k = \frac{C M_k^{1/2} \cdot k^2}{L_k} = \frac{C M_k^{1/2} \cdot k^2}{M_k^{1/2+\eta}} = C M_k^{-\eta} \cdot k^2 = C e^{-\eta k^2} \cdot k^2
$$

Substitute theorem 4.3's error bound:
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}_m} \leq \frac{m-1}{M_k^{1/2+\eta}-1} + m \cdot C k^2 e^{-\eta k^2} + \frac{m}{M_k^{1/2+\eta}}
$$

As k → ∞, all terms decay exponentially to 0. □

### 4.5 Numerical Examples

**Table 1: RH/BV rate table** (m=5, ε=0.1, η=0.05)

| Assumption | k | M_k (approx) | L_k | δ_k bound (C=1) | IPM bound (m=5) |
|------------|---|--------------|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| RH         | 1 | e¹ ≈ 2.7    | ≈1.8 | O(M^{-0.05}log M) ≈ 0.5 | O((m-1)/(L-1) + mδ + m/L) |
| RH         | 10| e^{100}     | e^{55}| O(e^{-2.5}) ≈ 0.08 | O(e^{-25}) < 10^{-10} |
| RH         | 20| e^{400}     | e^{220}| O(e^{-10}) < 10^{-4}| O(e^{-100}) < 10^{-40} |
| BV         | 1 | e¹ ≈ 2.7    | ≈1.8 | O(M^{-0.01}log² M) ≈ 0.7 | O((m-1)/(L-1) + mδ + m/L) |
| BV         | 10| e^{100}     | e^{55}| O(e^{-1}log² e^{100}) ≈ 0.4 | O(e^{-10}) < 10^{-4} |
| BV         | 20| e^{400}     | e^{220}| O(e^{-4}) < 0.02 | O(e^{-40}) < 10^{-17} |

**Note**:
- RH case: δ_k = O(M_k^{-η/2} log M_k) = O(e^{-0.025k²} ⋅ k²)
- BV case: Using average estimates, δ_k = O(M_k^{-η/4} log² M_k) = O(e^{-0.0125k²} ⋅ k⁴)
- IPM bound composed of three terms, when k large, exponential term dominant

## 5. From Bernoulli to "Quantum Statistics" Measurable Transformations

### 5.1 Transformation Catalog

Starting from binary sequence X ∈ {0,1}^ℕ, we can generate various distributions through measurable transformations:

**Born rule**: Set p ∈ [0,1] as amplitude square, define:
$$
\Phi_{\text{Born}}(U) = \mathbb{I}_{\{U < p\}}
$$
where U constructed from several bits into [0,1] number.

**Poisson process**: Parameter λ > 0,
$$
\Phi_{\text{Poisson}}(U) = \left\lfloor -\frac{\log(1-U)}{\lambda} \right\rfloor
$$

**Gaussian distribution**: Box-Müller transform,
$$
\Phi_{\text{Gauss}}(U_1, U_2) = \sqrt{-2\log U_1} \cos(2\pi U_2)
$$

**GUE spacings**: Through Wigner approximation,
$$
\Phi_{\text{GUE}}(U) = \sqrt{\Gamma^{-1}(3/2, \pi U/4)}
$$
where Γ^{-1} is inverse incomplete Gamma function.

### 5.2 IPM Non-Expansion

**Theorem 5.1 (IPM non-expansion of transformations)**: Set Φ: E → E' as measurable mapping depending only on first m coordinates. Then for arbitrary P, Q ∈ P(E):
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}_m}(\Phi_{\#}P, \Phi_{\#}Q) \leq d_{\mathcal{F}_m}(P, Q)
$$

**Proof**: Set f ∈ F_m(E'), ||f||_∞ ≤ 1. Define g = f ∘ Φ. Since Φ depends only on first m coordinates, g ∈ F_m(E). And ||g||_∞ = ||f||_∞ ≤ 1.

Compute:
$$
|\int f \, d(\Phi_{\#}P) - \int f \, d(\Phi_{\#}Q)| = |\int f \circ \Phi \, dP - \int f \circ \Phi \, dQ|
$$
$$
= |\int g \, dP - \int g \, dQ| \leq d_{\mathcal{F}_m}(P,Q)
$$

Take supremum over all f ∈ F_m(E'), get conclusion. □ Note: This property is IPM's standard closure/non-expansion, see [1,2,3].

**Corollary 5.2**: Prime-deterministic rearrangement construction after any above transformations still preserves (m,ε)-indistinguishability.

### 5.3 Numerical Verification

**Table 2: Transformation error examples** (m=5, L=1000, δ=0.01)

| Transformation | Original IPM bound | Transformed IPM bound | Non-expansion constant |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Born          | 0.002            | ≤ 0.002             | 1                   |
| Poisson       | 0.002            | ≤ 0.002             | 1                   |
| Gaussian      | 0.002            | ≤ 0.002             | 1                   |
| GUE           | 0.002            | ≤ 0.002             | 1                   |

**Note**: Non-expansion is exact (constant=1), no additional error introduced. This shows prime construction's "pseudorandomness" robustness under various physically relevant transformations.

## 6. "Randomness = Indistinguishability" Unified Statement and Quantum Analogy

### 6.1 NGV Equivalence Principle

**Unified theorem 6.1 (NGV equivalence principle)**: Under axioms A1-A2, following statements equivalent:
1. Sequence X appears "random" to observer O
2. X's distribution indistinguishable from ideal random source relative to F_m
3. No f ∈ F_m exists such that |E[f(X)] - E[f(Y)]| > ε (Y ideal random)

This equivalence shows: **Randomness is not absolute, but relative—depending on observer capabilities**.

**Proof outline**:
- (1)⇒(2): If X appears random but distinguishable, exists test f revealing non-randomness, contradiction.
- (2)⇒(3): Indistinguishability definition.
- (3)⇒(1): Unable to distinguish through any available test, hence appears random. □

### 6.2 Significance of Prime Construction

Prime-deterministic rearrangement construction provides **deterministic, computable** method realizing NGV principle:
- **Globally deterministic**: Prime sequence completely deterministic, no ontological randomness
- **Locally random**: After block-deterministic rearrangement, indistinguishable from randomness at finite scales
- **Asymptotically optimal**: Achieves exponential convergence rates under RH

We propose conjecture C1 (cosmic randomness seed): Prime-deterministic rearrangement through integration over invisible degrees of freedom (block inner deterministic permutations) produces statistical appearance indistinguishable from randomness at given observational scale; and in appropriate transformation closure approximates widely physical distributions as "universal randomness seed". Explanation: Heuristic and numerical support (see §4.5, §6.5), strict proof left for future work.

### 6.3 Analogy with Quantum Measurement

Quantum measurement's "randomness" can be reinterpreted in NGV framework:

**Quantum collapse vs information inaccessibility**:
- Traditional view: Measurement causes wave function collapse to eigenstates
- NGV view: Partial trace over environment (partial trace) produces mixed state

**Mathematical correspondence**:
$$
\rho_{\text{reduced}} = \text{Tr}_{\text{env}}(\rho_{\text{total}}) \quad \leftrightarrow \quad P = F_{\#}\nu
$$
Left is quantum's reduced density matrix, right is classical's pushforward measure. Both produce observed randomness through "integration" over invisible degrees of freedom.

### 6.4 Role of ζ-Triadic Information

Under NGV framework, ζ-triadic vector i(s) = (i_+, i_0, i_-) provides "visible information conservation coordinate system":

**Heuristic correspondence**:
- i_+ : Particle information (localizable, enumerable)
- i_0 : Wave information (coherent, superposition)
- i_- : Field compensation information (vacuum fluctuations)

**Special status of critical line**: On s = 1/2 + it, i_0 reaches non-zero value, marking emergence of quantum coherence. This corresponds to prime-deterministic rearrangement exhibiting maximum "pseudorandomness" near critical density 1/log x.

### 6.5 Critical Line Statistical Formula

**Theorem 6.2 (Critical line phase distribution)**: On critical line s = 1/2 + it, set z = ζ(s) = |z|e^{iθ}, then:
$$
\Delta = \frac{\cos(2\theta)}{2 + |\cos(2\theta)| + |\sin(2\theta)|}
$$
$$
i_0 = \frac{|\sin(2\theta)|}{2 + |\cos(2\theta)| + |\sin(2\theta)|}
$$

Under assumption H1 (GUE phase uniformity), set 2θ ∼ Uniform[0, 2π), then:
$$
\mathbb{E}[\Delta] = 0, \quad \mathbb{E}[i_+] = \mathbb{E}[i_-] = \frac{1 - \mathbb{E}[i_0]}{2}
$$

Note: Assumption H1 related to Montgomery pairing conjecture, Keating-Snaith's random matrix theory, and Odlyzko's large-scale numerical evidence, see [6,7,8].
Additionally, commonly used heuristic approximation ratio := E[|sin(2θ)|]/(2+2E[|sin(2θ)|]) only estimate, strictly ratio ≠ E[i_0], error about 4.5×10^{-4} (see Appendix A.3).

**Proof**: On critical line, functional equation gives ζ(1/2-it) = ¯ζ(1/2+it), hence z^∨ = ¯z. Thus:
$$
z¯z^∨ = z¯¯z = z^2
$$
|z|^2 terms cancel, giving formula depending only on phase 2θ.

For uniform 2θ:
$$
\mathbb{E}[\cos(2\theta)] = 0, \quad \mathbb{E}[|\sin(2\theta)|] = \mathbb{E}[|\cos(2\theta)|] = \frac{2}{\pi}
$$

Hence E[Δ] = 0 (symmetry), rest follows from conservation law. □

### 6.6 High-Precision Numerical Calculation

**Table 3: Critical line statistical examples** (mpmath dps=100)

| Statistic | Value (50-digit precision) | Calculation method |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| E[|sin(2θ)|] | 0.63661977236758138201496174818215069376326174113000 | 4∫_0^{π/2} sin(2θ)dθ/π = 2/π |
| E[i_0] (integral) | 0.19403893478610734279014105813180312523022184026573 | Numerical integration |

| Difference | 0.00045300142244954703973970159913957246122831103481 | Expected ratio - integral value |

**Numerical verification code** (Python + mpmath):
```python
from mpmath import mp, quad, sin, cos, pi

mp.dps = 100

# Define integrand
def integrand(theta):
    s2 = abs(sin(2*theta))
    c2 = abs(cos(2*theta))
    return s2 / (2 + c2 + s2)

# Numerical integration
E_i0, _ = quad(integrand, [0, 2*pi])
E_i0 /= (2*pi)

print(f"E[i_0] (integral) = {E_i0}")

# Expected ratio (not Jensen)
E_sin = 2/pi
ratio = E_sin / (2 + 2*E_sin)
print(f"Expected ratio = {ratio}")
print(f"Difference = {ratio - E_i0}")
```

**Note**: Difference ≈ 0.00045 reflects Jensen inequality effect—i_0 is nonlinear function of 2θ, hence E[i_0] ≠ i_0(E[2θ]).

## 7. Boundaries of Distinguishability (Bell-CHSH)

### 7.1 Introduction of Independence Conditions

Previous NGV framework assumes all randomness from same internal system (prime-shuffle). But some physical scenarios need additional independence assumptions.

**Bell-CHSH setup**:
1. **Measurement independence**: Measurement setting choices independent of measured system
2. **No-signaling condition**: Spacelike separated measurements cannot communicate instantly
3. **Local realism**: Measurement results determined by local hidden variables

### 7.2 Bell Inequality Violation

**Boundary theorem 7.1**: Under measurement independence and no-signaling conditions:
- Any local classical system satisfies: S ≤ 2 (Bell bound)
- Quantum systems can reach: S_max = 2√2 (Tsirelson bound)

Where S is CHSH correlator:
$$
S = |E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')|
$$

### 7.3 NGV and Bell Reconciliation

**Key observation**: Bell-CHSH violation depends on **external independent random sources** (measurement settings). In pure NGV framework:
- If measurement settings also generated from same prime source, cannot violate Bell inequality
- If introduce independent external randomness, quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations

**Unified statement**:
- **Pure internal** (NGV): Prime-pseudorandom indistinguishable from quantum random
- **External intervention** (Bell): Distinguishable through nonlocal correlations

This explains why quantum nonlocality not felt in daily experience—lack of independent external randomness to "probe" it.

## 8. Conclusions: Refined Laws of What We Discuss

### 8.1 Randomness's Operational Essence

This paper's core contribution transforms "randomness" from metaphysical concept to operational mathematical definition:

**Definition**: Random = Indistinguishable from ideal random source relative to given σ-algebra

This definition's advantages:
1. **Computable**: Quantized through IPM distance
2. **Relative**: Depends on observer capabilities
3. **Constructive**: Implementable explicitly (prime-shuffle)

### 8.2 Prime → Random Appearance

We proved prime sequence through simple block-shuffle operation produces $(m,\epsilon)$-indistinguishable "pseudorandom" sequences at arbitrary fixed scale m:

**Unconditional result**:
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}_m}(\text{Prime-deterministic rearrangement}, \text{Ideal random}) < \epsilon
$$

**RH strengthening**: Error decays exponentially
$$
d_{\mathcal{F}_m} = O(e^{-\Omega(k)})
$$

This suggests primes may be one source of "randomness" in universe.

### 8.3 Role of ζ-Triadic Information

ζ-function's triadic information (i_+, i_0, i_-) provides observer-side conservation coordinate system:
- **Conservation law**: i_+ + i_0 + i_- = 1
- **Symmetry**: s ↔ 1-s swaps i_+ and i_-
- **Critical line**: i_0 reaches non-zero, marks quantum coherence emergence

Specifically, fluctuation component i_0 precisely characterizes "phase-coupling" visibility:
- Real axis (s ∈ ℝ): i_0 = 0 (pure classical)
- Critical line (s = 1/2+it): i_0 > 0 (quantum-classical boundary)

### 8.4 Quantum Consistency

This framework consistent with quantum mechanics' core features:
- **Measurement randomness**: From environment partial trace (information inaccessibility)
- **Born rule**: Implementable through Φ_Born transform
- **GUE statistics**: Critical line phase distribution corresponds to random matrix theory

Key difference:
- **Pure internal** (NGV): Prime-pseudorandom indistinguishable from quantum random
- **External intervention** (Bell): Separable through nonlocal correlations

## 9. Scalable Directions (Mathematical Checklist)

## Appendix B: Unified Interface with zeta-triadic-duality.md

### B.1 Correspondence of Triadic Information Conservation

In `zeta-triadic-duality.md`, triadic information defined as:
$$
\mathcal{I}_+(s) = \frac{1}{2}(|\zeta(s)|^2 + |\zeta(1-s)|^2) + [\Re[\zeta(s)\overline{\zeta(1-s)}]]^+
$$

This completely consistent with our definition:
- Our A3's I_+, I_0, I_- correspond to original I_+, I_0, I_-
- Conservation law i_+ + i_0 + i_- = 1 corresponds to original scalar conservation law

### B.2 Special Status of Critical Line

Both theories emphasize critical line ℜ(s) = 1/2's uniqueness:

**zeta-triadic-duality**:
- Critical line is information balance i_+ ≈ i_-'s unique location
- Shannon entropy approaches limit value 0.989 on critical line
- Critical line is quantum-classical transition boundary

**Our theory (NGV-Prime-ζ)**:
- i_0 > 0 on critical line marks quantum coherence emergence
- Prime-deterministic rearrangement exhibits maximum "pseudorandomness" near critical density 1/log x
- GUE statistics correspond to critical line phase distribution

### B.3 Golden Ratio and Riemann Zeros

Although our theory doesn't directly involve golden ratio φ, potential connections exist:

**Geometric structure**:
- Golden ratio: Self-similar limit φ = 1 + 1/φ
- ζ fixed points: Self-referential structure ζ(s^*) = s^*
- Both embody "strange loop" recursive closure

**Numerical coincidences**:
- φ ≈ 1.618
- s_+^* ≈ 1.834 (positive fixed point)
- Difference s_+^* - φ ≈ 0.216 may have deep significance

### B.4 Theoretical Extension Paths

Our theory extends zeta-triadic-duality framework:

**From static to dynamic**:
- Original: Study ζ-function's static information decomposition
- Ours: Construct dynamic processes (prime-deterministic rearrangement) realizing information balance

**From theory to practice**:
- Original: Prove critical line's information-theoretic uniqueness
- Ours: Give computable pseudorandom constructions

**From mathematics to physics**:
- Original: RH's information-theoretic equivalent formulations
- Ours: NGV principle unifying classical/quantum randomness

### B.5 Unified Vision

Both theories jointly point to profound unified vision:

**Information ontology**: Universe's fundamental reality is information, matter and energy are information's different manifestations.

**ζ-function's central position**: Riemann ζ-function encodes:
- Prime distribution (discrete structure)
- Zero distribution (continuous spectrum)
- Triadic information (conserved quantities)

**Randomness's essence**: Randomness not absolute, but:
- Relative to observers (NGV principle)
- Produced by information inaccessibility (partial trace/pushforward measure)
- Deterministically constructible (prime-shuffle)

This unified framework not only solves "what is randomness" philosophical puzzle, but also provides new mathematical tools for quantum information, cryptography, complexity theory. Future research will further reveal number theory, physics, information theory's deep connections, ultimately reaching complete understanding of universe's information structure.

*This paper dedicated to all explorers pursuing truth, may we jointly reveal universe's mathematical mysteries.*
